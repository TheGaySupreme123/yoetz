"""Every public result model with a nested collection must project from a real internal result.

Two projection defects of the same class shipped in a row. PR #50 fixed a phantom null on
``publish_work``'s accepted events; the class survived and reappeared as nested findings that the
strict closed models could not accept at all, on ``check``. Each fix was verified against the one
operation that had been observed failing, so nothing ever asked whether the *rest* of the public
surface projected.

This sweep asks. It runs one realistic workflow through the real ready composition and projects
every public result model — and every status view — asserting that each nested collection the
models declare is present and populated in the response the caller receives. A vacuous pass is the
failure mode that let this class live, so an expectation that names a collection also requires it
to be non-empty.

The sweep deliberately states its invariant structurally: *nested collections project*. It never
names the internal container type that happened to break, because the next instance of this class
will arrive wearing a different type.
