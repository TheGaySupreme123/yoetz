"""A check refused behind a native capture handoff converges once the handoff drains (#838).

The native failure was a deterministic check that returned retryable ``OPERATION_PENDING`` twice
while ``status view=operation`` reported ``absent``. The storage-level shape of that failure: a
pending check that nobody renews keeps deferring the observation append that would consume the
task's capture handoff, and every new check on the task waits on that handoff. These tests drive
that interleaving with explicit clock steps and ticket transitions, never sleeps.
