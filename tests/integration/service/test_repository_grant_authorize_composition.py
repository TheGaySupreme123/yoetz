"""Repository-privacy-grant authorization over the real composition (#519, #552).

The defect the granted lane locks against: an exact prepared `repository_privacy_grant` was
authorized, the durable policy transition committed, the real confidential server sent the
terminal result — and a lost close confirmation collapsed the whole ceremony to
`elevated_bootstrap: repository_privacy_grant_failed` while `yoetz provider status` already
reported the grant effective. Both named external-review recipes (Assisted and Expanded) run
that lane: PR #542 switched the single lane to Expanded, which silently dropped the Assisted
end-to-end coverage this file restores (#552).

The tightened lane (#552) starts from a granted Expanded repository and applies the strictly
tighter Assisted recipe through the same chat-consent lane. The lattice (ADR-009 / ADR-016) says a
tightening needs no human decision: the service applies it immediately, the consent result reports
`tightened`, and the ledger shows exactly which row was recorded.

These tests run real agent attestation, the real ordinary-control propose path, and the real
YZH1/YZS1 decide ceremony against the production daemon composition, mocking only the OS keyring
backend and the configured provider binding.
