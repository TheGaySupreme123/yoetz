"""Honesty conformance: weaker coverage never yields a stronger public conclusion.

These tests systematically weaken one coverage dimension at a time (authorship assurance,
artifact observation, evidence immutability, ledger freshness) and prove the merged ``weakest``
result, the retained ``known_gaps`` labels, and a finding's ``rank_key`` ordering all track the
weaker input -- never the stronger one. They also prove imported and redacted material can never
be strengthened back to current/complete coverage by combining it with stronger evidence.
