"""Honesty conformance: receipts and their rendered text never overclaim beyond frozen evidence.

Every case in the reviewed ``fixtures/receipts/*.case.json`` corpus that carries a
``receipt_document`` is decoded through the real domain codec (``receipt_document_from_json``),
rendered through the real compact renderer (``render_receipt_compact``), and checked against the
fixture's own frozen expectations: the exact compact sentence, the absence of every
``forbidden_claims``/``forbidden_content`` phrase, and an explicit limitations surface whenever
coverage carries a gap or the document carries a redaction. Variants without a ``receipt_document``
(rejected malformed inputs) must render no wording at all.
