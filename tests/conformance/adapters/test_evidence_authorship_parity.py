"""Evidence authorship facts and ``author=mine`` agree on both ledger backends (issue #914).

The SQLite ledger answers status pages through the same frozen-prefix oracle as the memory ledger,
so both must attribute a readable evidence row to its source event, list it for its own writer
only, and withdraw the attribution when a later redaction targets that source event: a pinned
read replays its own prefix, and self-authorship must never re-disclose owner-redacted prose.
