"""Guidance, skills and every rendering agree on the closure stop signal (issue #913, ADR-032).

After ``closure_readiness.state`` reads ``ready_with_limitations`` nothing is left to do, and no
shipped surface may send the agent back to recheck unchanged state. These tests pin the phrases
agents rely on in the workflow's Completion section, the coverage guide, the receipt template and
every host skill, and check that the frozen directive every renderer shares is the owner-approved
stop sentence, instructs no further check, and never claims the work was verified.
