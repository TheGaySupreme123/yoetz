"""Evidence discovery guidance asks only for what the agent can see (issue #914).

The shipped guidance used to tell agents to read every page of `status view=evidence` and match
items on their bounded description before publishing evidence or claiming completion. Under the
default `agent_context` ceiling every other writer's and every host-observed description projects
as omitted (`local_disclosure_not_authorized`), so the walk could never match: in the DeepSWE v2
run agents paged 90,668 blanked rows across 1,037 pages and reused a walked ID once in 58
attempts. These tests keep the old procedure out of every shipped surface and pin the replacement:
cite the IDs you published, find native captures with a filter, relate them only through a
structural link, and read an omitted description as a privacy setting rather than absence.
