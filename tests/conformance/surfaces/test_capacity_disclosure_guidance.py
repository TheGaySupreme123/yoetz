"""Agent guidance, skills, and the shared renderer say the same thing about capacity (issue #828).

A larger or uncapped observation capacity is a local-hardware and cost decision that belongs to
the owner. The guidance tells agents to run the preview, relay its disclosure, apply only after
acceptance, and relay the typed no-cap outcome verbatim. These tests pin the phrases agents rely
on in every shipped guidance source and check that the one human renderer used by the CLI and the
terminal interface actually emits the sentences the guidance and user documentation promise.

The MCP-initialize safety floor (`agent-instructions.md`) carries no capacity section: with its
unrelated passages intact it already fills the replicated advertised-surface budget, so the rule
lives in the workflow procedure and in every skill, which points there.
