"""The agent install guide names the platform boundary and the no-question-tool rule (issue #709).

Two first-time users hit the same two holes: an agent on Cursor, which has no structured question
tool, asked nothing and chose for them; and an agent on native Windows watched every command fail
as ``internal_error`` before working out that Yoetz is POSIX-only. The guide, the shipped install
page, and the CLI refusal must keep telling the same story.
