"""Host entrypoints must name start-first and failed-start intro recovery.

Issue #692's instruction-delivery slice (not a PreToolUse deny gate): Codex, Claude Code, and
Cursor catalog descriptions and skill bodies, plus SessionStart inactive context, tell a new
session to call `start` before substantive work and to follow recovery before asking for intro and guidance if startup
remains blocked. Wording is not enforcement.
