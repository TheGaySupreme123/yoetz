"""Packaging gate: the Codex and Cursor initialize instructions keep their stated byte cap (#918).

Codex code mode builds every advertised tool's description from the initialize instructions, the
tool description and a generated declaration, so the instructions are charged once per tool. Issue
#918 states a 2,048-byte cap for the packaged compact body those hosts receive, recorded in
``docs/runbooks/codex-integration.md``. The route tail and the longest admissible destination
disclosure (#479) ride on top and are never trimmed to fit. This test fails the build when the
packaged body, or any rendering of it, outgrows that cap, so the saving cannot regress silently as
the text is edited. It sits next to the Claude cap gate (#789).
