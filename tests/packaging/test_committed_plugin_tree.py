"""The plugin tree committed at ``.agents/plugins/yoetz/`` must equal a real install.

That tree is a generated artifact: the output of ``install_plugin`` at
``IntegrationScope.TRUSTED_PROJECT``, committed so a contributor who clones this repository and
runs Codex in it gets the yoetz skill, MCP server, and hooks for working on *this* repository. It
is deliberately absent from the sdist and the wheel -- package users install their own copy.

Because nothing regenerated it, it drifted. The consent-security change that landed in
``guidance/agent-instructions.md`` never reached the committed copy, so for several commits every
contributor's Codex agent read superseded instructions telling it to satisfy a confirmation phrase
it could see -- the exact pattern that change removed. The packaged tree was correct throughout;
only this checked-in install was stale, and no gate compared them.

``README.md`` states guidance is owned once under ``guidance/`` and shipped byte-identically
everywhere. These cases are what make that claim falsifiable for this surface.
