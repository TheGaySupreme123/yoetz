"""Closure-readiness wire builder for tests that hand-author a status result.

Status producers derive the checklist fields (``state``, ``agent_actionable``, …) from the same
blocking conditions and gaps; hand-authored vectors use this helper so they stay consistent with
``yoetz.kernel.closure_readiness`` instead of restating the split in every test.
