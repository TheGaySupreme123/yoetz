"""Real privacy receipt views, shared by the CLI rendering and wire-schema regressions.

Issues #731 and #732 were both missed because every test built its receipts inline: the CLI
rendering path never saw a decoded ``datetime`` and the control wire never saw the product's own
local-disclosure purpose.  One builder keeps those two surfaces on the same values.
