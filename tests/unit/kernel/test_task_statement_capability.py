"""Which ledger events count as able to have given a reviewer the task statement (issue #908).

The pre-statement resolution fallback lets an AI-powered finding raised before any review could
have held the user's request clear on a later review that also lacked it. A ``session_opened``
1.2.0 event may carry a statement, but a lineage-only child opens on that version without one, so
the envelope alone overstates what the ledger held. A readable payload decides; a payload the
ledger can no longer read (redacted, key unavailable) still counts, so a later redaction never
makes a review that held the statement look as though it predates it.
