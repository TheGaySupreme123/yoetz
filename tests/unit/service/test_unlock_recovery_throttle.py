"""Installation recovery verifies a secret, so it must be throttled like one.

Recovery staged its clean throttle generation *before* `recover_passphrase` had verified
anything. That write zeroes `consecutive_failures` and the pending delay, so every failed attempt
handed back an unthrottled next attempt, and merely starting a recovery cleared a delay the
passphrase path had accumulated. `begin_installation_recovery` also skipped the delay check that
`begin_passphrase_unlock` performs.
