"""Every shell command the terminal interface tells a person to run must exist.

The interface hands over to the CLI whenever it cannot finish a ceremony itself
(a passphrase prompt that needs a real terminal, a credential store, a service
start). Those fallbacks are string literals, so nothing at import time notices
when the command they name is renamed or never existed: a person only finds out
after the ceremony has already failed once. This resolves each literal against
the real Typer tree instead, options included.
