"""``/observe`` shows the effective budget and changes capacity only through a disclosed preview.

A larger local retention capacity costs disk, memory, and CPU work, and "no Yoetz cap" is not
supported by the structural queue in this storage revision (#828). These tests drive the flow
with a fake runtime and pin the owner-visible contract: the status block names the effective
budget, every change is previewed with the shared disclosure wording before anything is applied,
cancel and ``Esc`` change nothing and say so, apply sends exactly the previewed digest, and a
no-cap request explains itself without calling apply.
