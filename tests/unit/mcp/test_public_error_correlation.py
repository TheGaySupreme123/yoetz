"""Every agent-facing correlation id the bridge mints must resolve in the durable ring.

Issue #191: the ids handed to an agent for deterministic failures (`INVALID_REQUEST`,
`OPERATION_PENDING`) were minted straight into the wire envelope and written to no sink, so a
maintainer handed one from a transcript found zero records. These lock the mint-and-record pairing
and the no-second-mint rule that keeps one failure on one id.
