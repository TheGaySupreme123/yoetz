"""A misplaced known field must be answered with its one legal owning family.

Replays the 2026-08-14 dogfood: `attempted_items` published on `claim_recorded.payload` was
rejected with the claim family's admitted keys (issue #240 working as designed), but nothing said
the field is legal on `action_recorded.payload`, so the agent repaired by deleting it and the
accepted batch silently lost requested-item attempt accounting (issue #266).

The request stays rejected. The addition is one bounded repair fact — in `safe_details`, in the
authoring hint, and in the compatible text summary — whose every value is frozen schema or
registry content. Ambiguous fields, envelope-owned fields, and caller-invented keys never receive
ownership guidance.
