In the supervised dogfood run the agent, on reaching a pending disclosure, went looking in
Yoetz's SQLite catalog and product source for the pending id, issued a fresh check request, and
told the user the task was complete before semantic closure. None of those are things the text
told it to do — they are what an agent does when the text says nothing.
