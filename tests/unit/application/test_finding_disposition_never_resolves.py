"""Only a later qualifying check resolves a finding; no response disposition ever does.

The 2026-07-30 dogfood agent repaired the record, recorded an evidence-backed ``acknowledged``
response, saw the next check return no findings, and still received ``unresolved_findings_remain``.
Half of that was deliberate and still is: a disposition is an answer on the record, not proof.
The other half was a defect (issue #458): ``application/receipt._finding_states`` hard-wired every
current finding to ``resolved=False``, so a repaired record could never earn a clean receipt. These
cases lock both halves of the contract the agent guidance now makes: dispositions never resolve,
and a later deterministic qualifying check that finds the same issue absent does.
