"""The reviewer's standing instruction: one source, a verifying role, no self-flagging (issue #906).

The instruction is prose, so these tests pin the exact sentences each requirement rests on rather
than a digest: a reworded rule should fail here with the rule's name, not as an opaque hash change.
They also pin what must *not* change: the honesty rules (#885/#891) stay, the challenge cap stays,
and an open work obligation is still raised.
