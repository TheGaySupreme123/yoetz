"""Snapshot of the reviewer's task-statement rule (issue #908).

The instruction is pinned byte for byte: the reviewer reads the task statement as the
specification, never asks for behaviour the statement excludes (the termenv Ascii tail), cites
the statement for an omitted requirement, and weighs an agent-transcribed statement as the
agent's account. Every adapter that composes its own system instruction carries the same rule.
