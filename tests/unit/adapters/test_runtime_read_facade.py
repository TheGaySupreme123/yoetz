"""Read-route runtime facades must cover what read-routed code calls.

``status(view=operation)`` failed for every caller, every time: it calls ``lookup_task_operation``, but
a read route hands the application ``_ReadLedger``, a ``__slots__`` facade that exposed only a
subset of the port and not that one, so the call raised ``AttributeError`` before reaching data — and
the recovery view was unavailable exactly when a caller needed it.

Every status test passed throughout, because they drive the raw ledger directly and never cross
the routing facade. Two surfaces that have to agree, and nothing compared them. This does.
