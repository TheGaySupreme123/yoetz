"""The trusted terminal names every widening, in words, before it asks.

This closes the last link of the trace: a widening the classifier recognizes produces a change,
the preview type accepts only a complete change set, and the renderer must have a fixed label for
every field it is handed. Any dimension that reaches approval without appearing on screen fails
here rather than on a user's terminal.

Labels are asserted as literal wording. The whole point of this screen is that a person can read
it, so its text is a product promise and not an implementation detail.
