"""Every result leaf the models can emit must classify to exactly one rule.

``classify_result_leaf`` raises ``invalid_json_pointer`` when a leaf matches zero rules or more
than one exact rule. That call sits inside the post-commit projection window, so a registry gap
does not degrade gracefully: it converts an already-durable operation into a failure the caller
cannot replay away. ``_build_result_leaf_rules`` guards itself with a hardcoded rule count, which
detects that rules were added or removed but cannot detect that a *model* grew a field no rule
covers. This derives the leaf space from the models themselves and closes that hole.
