    ``append_diagnostic_record`` defaults to the platform ``log_dir()``, so any test exercising a
    path that records one appends to the machine's own ``service.diagnostics.jsonl``. Individual
    tests that assert on records already redirect it; this makes the default safe for the ones
    that only pass through. A test that sets its own ``log_dir`` still wins, because its
    ``monkeypatch`` is applied after this fixture and undone before it.

    The import is deliberately inside the fixture. The portable console-boundary job runs
    ``tests/unit/cli/test_trusted_console.py`` with pytest alone and no project dependencies, and
    this file is a ``conftest`` on that path; importing the diagnostics module at module scope
    pulls in ``platformdirs`` through ``yoetz.config.paths`` and breaks collection there.
