"""Hermetic process environment for every case under ``tests/subprocess``.

Child processes spawned through ``helpers.child.spawn_installed`` or ``isolated_environment``
already receive a minimal, owner-only environment. The in-process cases (``CliRunner`` driving
``yoetz.cli.app``) do not: the product resolves its default configuration, state, cache, and
runtime endpoints from the pytest process environment, so without this fixture they read the
developer's real ``config.toml`` and can even reach the developer's running service (issue #551).

    """Rebase ``HOME`` and every XDG root onto a private per-test tree; drop ``YOETZ_*``.

    This is the same contract the ``cli-mcp-subprocess`` CI job applies to the whole job
    (``HOME``, ``XDG_CONFIG_HOME``, ``XDG_DATA_HOME``, ``XDG_CACHE_HOME`` under the job temp),
    extended with ``XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`` so endpoint resolution cannot fall back to a platform
    default outside the tree (on Linux that would be the real ``/run/user/<uid>``), and with a
    scrub of inherited ``YOETZ_*`` variables so neither a developer's exports nor the CI job's
    own ``YOETZ_DENY_NETWORK``/``YOETZ_CANDIDATE_PYTHON`` reach the strict config loader, which
    refuses every unknown ``YOETZ_``-prefixed name. Underscore-prefixed harness variables such
    as ``_YOETZ_TEST_INSTALLATION`` are not product configuration and survive.

    ``XDG_STATE_HOME`` is unset rather than pinned, matching CI: ``state_dir()`` then follows
    ``HOME`` on both platforms, which cases that rebase ``HOME`` themselves and read the state
    tree back (``test_hooks_cli``) depend on.

    The tree lives under the real ``~/.cache/yoetz-subprocess-isolation`` rather than pytest's
    ``tmp_path``: ``verify_private_local_bundle`` rejects shared temp (Linux ``/tmp``), and
    ``isolated_environment`` derives its own child installation tree from ``Path.home()`` at
    call time, so the override must itself be a location path safety accepts. ``platformdirs``
    honours the XDG variables on macOS as well as Linux, so resolution is identical on both.
