# ADR-003 — Storage, SQLite build, and durability

**Status:** Working decision for spec drafting (2026-07-13). Ratification requires the full
fault/contention matrix on both advertised platforms.
**Implemented by:** `docs/INTERFACES.md`, `src/yoetz/adapters/sqlite/`,
`src/yoetz/ports/ledger.py`, `src/yoetz/ports/runtime.py`, root and packaged
`migrations/`, and the storage suites under `tests/integration/storage/` and `tests/subprocess/`.

## Decisions

1. **SQLite delivery:** APSW pinned exactly `3.53.3.1` carrying SQLite `3.53.3` amalgamation.
   Startup verifies `apsw.apsw_version()`, `apsw.sqlite_lib_version()`, `using_amalgamation`,
   exact `sqlite_source_id()`
   (`2026-06-26 20:14:12 d4c0e51e4aeb96955b99185ab9cde75c339e2c29c3f3f12428d364a10d782c62`),
   and support-manifest compile options. Unknown builds: read-only inspection allowed, writes
   fail closed (`STORAGE_UNSAFE`). Multi-connection WAL floor: 3.51.3+ (WAL-reset fix). The
   stdlib `sqlite3` adapter is test/reference only.
2. **PRAGMAs / connection contract:** WAL (verified, not assumed),
   `synchronous=FULL` (verified), `foreign_keys=ON`, `trusted_schema=OFF`, `temp_store=MEMORY`,
   `busy_timeout=5000`, `wal_autocheckpoint=0` (owner-run bounded PASSIVE checkpoints),
   `mmap_size=0`, extension loading disabled. `PRAGMA application_id = 0x594F4554` ("YOET"),
   current `user_version` from the ordered catalog and bundle migration registries.
   Runtime authorizers permit the read-only `table_info(observation_consent)` schema probe on
   writer and inspection connections so structural-only and native-content consent remain
   distinguishable. Other table arguments and configuration-changing PRAGMAs remain denied
   unless independently listed in the connection policy. Observation tests must exercise the
   production authorizer, including supported older consent schemas (issue #616).
3. **Transactions:** `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` for every write path; the append transaction contains only
   bounded indexed reads/writes. All hashing, validation, encryption, object
   fsync, and network work happens outside. Acknowledge only after COMMIT returns.
4. **Layout:** platform app-data `…/yoetz/` with `catalog.sqlite3` + `tasks/<task-id>/` bundles.
   One task per bundle database. Owner-only permissions; symlink/hardlink/
   traversal rejection; repo, cloud-synced, network, and world-readable paths unsupported and
   detected where practical (`STORAGE_UNSAFE`). "Network" includes the VM-boundary transports
   `9p`, `drvfs`, and `virtiofs` (issue #723). Yoetz has not certified locking and crash durability
   across these host/guest shares, so state inside WSL must live on the distribution's own disk,
   never under `/mnt/<letter>`. This is a conservative support boundary: virtiofs implementations
   can support POSIX locks, but that alone is not Yoetz durability evidence.
5. **Schema:** migration `0001` is the canonical initial schema for both
   catalog and bundle (STRICT tables, WITHOUT ROWID where keyed by text, CHECK-enforced state
   machines). Structural columns never contain user plaintext.
6. **Object publication protocol:** encrypted temp file → flush → fsync(file) → atomic rename
   into `objects/<2-hex-prefix>/` → fsync(dir) → only then referenced inside the append
   transaction. Native Claude Code and Cursor content, and source-qualified Codex hook content,
   use the same service-side publication protocol before their structural observation enters the
   FIFO ledger: the service reserves a metadata-only capture ticket, writes the encrypted object
   and manifest, and marks the ticket pending only after the expected set is complete. The Codex
   hook arm is profileless: it is selected by the exact `codex_hook` source and active observation
   consent authority, not by a Claude/Cursor content profile. Codex session-stream content remains
   on its separate path. Orphans are
   collectable after a 24 h safety window, never while referenced by a maintenance pin or an
   outstanding capture ticket.
7. **Backup/restore/migration:** online Backup API only (APSW destination-side `backup`);
   frontier-pinned manifests; restore into a quarantined new bundle then atomic catalog switch;
   canonical event bytes never rewritten by migration; newer unknown write-schema fails closed.
8. **Corruption response:** integrity failure quarantines the bundle (writes disabled,
   `STORAGE_CORRUPT`), preserves originals under `quarantine/`, and directs to
   backup/restore. Projection-only corruption is repaired by generation replay. A deterministic
   failure to rehydrate one pending operation's resume pointer is not bundle integrity failure:
   recovery quarantines that operation as `operation_resume_object_invalid` and keeps the ledger
   live (issue #443). Chain, writer, and object-inventory integrity failures remain
   bundle-terminal. Recovery of an
   existing bundle must remain cooperative with the trusted local service: decoding yields in
   bounded batches and the pure CPU replay reducer runs outside the service event loop, so one
   large or corrupt task cannot monopolize ordinary control. An observation route that encounters
   `STORAGE_CORRUPT` does not reinterpret the bundle as healthy or retry indefinitely; ADR-010's
   terminal observation quarantine contains that delivery lane while preserving the original
   storage recovery contract.

## Amendment — task lineage and project metadata (2026-09-05, issue #494 / ADR-027)

Decision 4 is unchanged: the on-disk layout remains `catalog.sqlite3` + `tasks/<task-id>/`, and
one task still owns one bundle. Lineage (`parent_task_id`, depth, lineage digest, origin,
acceptance, and work state) and project membership are catalog metadata, not a second ledger
inside the parent bundle. A child is a separate bundle. Clients never open sibling or child
bundles (ADR-008). The #498 ownership inventory decides which workspace-keyed stores are
task-owned provenance and which are shared mutable coordination state. Expected shared-mutable
candidates are migration-0004 workspace-to-session routing and the migration-0003 verification-job
scheduling authority (including the per-workspace running-job uniqueness); only inventory-designated
state may move under ADR-027 / issue #496. Job results, inspection snapshots, and session advice
remain task-owned unless that inventory proves otherwise. This decision introduces no shared
writable ledger.

9. **Native capture handoff:** Claude Code and Cursor ordinary native profiles, and the
   source-qualified profileless Codex hook arm, have a bounded service-side staging lane. A
   capture-only request crosses the authenticated local-control boundary, secret-scans and
   encrypts each eligible chunk, publishes its object and manifest with the object protocol above,
   and records a ticket containing only commitments, encrypted object IDs, source/session/cursor
   identity, the original source and content-authority generations, profile when applicable, and
   expected content groups/parts. For Codex, the ticket is fenced to the exact active consent
   authority/generation, task, workspace commitment, Yoetz and host session, `codex_hook` source
   identity and commitment, source generation, tool-call correlation, expected multipart
   groups/parts, object kinds, and object/content digests. No Codex content profile is inferred or
   accepted. The
   structural observation request may advance the FIFO ledger only after it revalidates the source
   and authority generations and the complete expected group/part set; partial, conflicting, or
   unreadable sets remain unavailable and are never promoted by inference.

   For the Codex hook arm, only explicitly linked tool output, selected changed-file/code bytes, and
   workspace-diff bytes are eligible for captured-content evidence and AI-powered review selection.
   Session-stream records remain outside this native ticket lane and are excluded from AI-powered
   review selection. Tool input and path/locator content are excluded from AI-powered review
   selection too, though the current Codex hook path may still stage consented input/locator chunks
   in the bounded encrypted local capture lane pending a follow-up staging filter. Encrypted staging
   does not authorize disclosure: AI-powered review case selection still requires the effective
   repository privacy authority and the independently authorized provider/attempt route.

   `staging` and `pending` tickets are bounded to 512 outstanding entries per workspace.
   Revoked tickets do not consume that quota, but their metadata-only tombstones remain so an
   old ticket cannot be replayed after a pause, revoke, disable, or re-enable ABA cycle. A
   successful structural append removes its consumed ticket. A new check/frozen-case acquisition
   sees an outstanding ticket under the same bundle transaction and returns retryable
   `OPERATION_PENDING`; retrying the same request reuses the ticket identity and encrypted
   manifests rather than creating another capture or ledger append. The capture-only lane has its
   own bounded lock and may stage while a heavy structural append is running; object and manifest
   writes remain serialized and bounded.

   When a new CHECK encounters the capture barrier, READY reconciles a bounded listing for the
   exact routed task against current local content authority before one freeze retry. It tombstones
   only tickets whose authority is absent, inactive, revoked, runtime-disabled, profile-unselected,
   or from an old authority generation, so a direct capture-only request with no structural outbox
   row cannot leave a permanent barrier. Matching active tickets remain retryable as `check_admission_capture_pending`; a completed
   same-request replay returns without inspecting newer tickets, and encrypted objects and
   captured history are unchanged. When the capture lock is free, the preflight also tombstones an
   active ticket at least 30 seconds old whose structural row is no longer queued, and the READY
   maintenance sweep does the same across the workspace's task bundles without waiting for a
   CHECK or new native input (#836). A structural row that commits without consuming its matched
   ticket, or is refused terminally, retires that ticket itself.

   This handoff is a local durability boundary, not an offline guarantee. It contains no
   plaintext spool. A host kill or service failure before authenticated staging completes may
   leave an honest content gap; once the encrypted ticket is committed, service restart and a
   retry may resume it without re-reading plaintext from a local spool.

## Amendment — compatible bundle upgrade at the READY boundary (2026-09-12)

The package update path has one narrowly bounded automatic schema transition. After the catalog is
current and before the new service generation is composed as READY, the service may invoke
`BundleUpgradeCoordinator.run_before_ready` with catalog-derived `BundleUpgradeTarget` values. It
must acquire the exclusive-holder callback before touching a stale bundle; an ordinary lazy
`open_writer()` remains fail-closed on `migration_required` and never upgrades a task as a side
effect of opening it.

The restart-discoverable marker is the existing catalog `maintenance_operations` row, not a new
marker table. `SqliteBundleUpgradeJournal` reserves `kind = 'migration'` with
`requested_target_version = '14'`, a generated `request_id`, `migration_request_digest()` and
`migration_plan_digest()`. The plan binds the task, route identity/generation, subject frontier,
privacy-root generation/digest, supported source versions `12` and `13`, and migration IDs
`0013`–`0014`. A pending row owns a lease and advances
only through `reserved → backup_ready → schema_applied → replay_verified`; terminal rows carry the
canonical `MigrationResult`, its backup manifest digest, and either `complete` or `quarantined`
state. A restarted service inspects that row and the bundle schema, then resumes or refuses the
same operation; it never creates a second migration for the same target.

The supported automatic sources are bundle schemas `12` and `13`, targeting schema `14`.
Schema `12` applies released provider-usage migration `0013` followed by lineage migration `0014`;
schema `13` applies only `0014`. Released migrations `0010`–`0013` retain their exact bytes.
The consent-profile column and events layout are checked before the lineage rebuild. A development
schema `13` with the former lineage layout is refused rather than mistaken for the released
provider-usage schema. The verified backup supplies the actual source version even after restart.
Preservation digests represent absent v12 usage columns as NULL, matching migration `0013`, while
retaining all existing v13 usage counters. A v10 layout that cannot be identified as the released
shape fails as
`schema_upgrade_path_unknown` before mutation; newer, missing, unsafe, or non-contiguous schemas
fail closed as well.

For every candidate, `BundleUpgradeEffects.ensure_machine_backup` creates or reopens the same
machine-bound, frontier-pinned backup before DDL. The migration writer is the narrow
`_open_bundle_migration_writer()` capability; it is closed before the normal verified writer is
reopened. `capture_sqlite_integrity()` and the injected `verify_replay()` compare task identity,
canonical event history/count, frontier, object inventory, preserved metadata/table digests, and
the deterministic projection replay digest. The resulting `MigrationResult` requires an unchanged
frontier before the journal is terminalized.

A failure before a proved schema commit can retry when the old schema is intact. A post-commit,
reopen, verification, or journal uncertainty preserves the backup and target and quarantines the
maintenance operation as `rollback_required`; READY stays blocked until the supported restore or
rollback procedure establishes a verified route. This path never performs reverse SQL, rewrites
canonical event bytes, or treats package replacement as data-upgrade completion.

The package-update authorization is schema-only. It preserves task bundles, settings, permissions,
host integrations, object roots, observation consent, event bytes, and frontiers; it adds no
observation, content, provider, disclosure, or egress authority. Explicit backup, restore, and
ad-hoc `migrate execute` continue to use their own exact review and plan-digest contract.

### Amendment — semantic progress table and the v15 target (2026-09-22, issue #571 A2)

Bundle migration `0015` adds one STRICT, WITHOUT ROWID table, `semantic_progress`, keyed by the
existing `semantic_jobs.job_id`. It holds only closed structural values: the attempt ordinal, the
furthest non-terminal phase and its rank (a CHECK binds the two), and three exact-millisecond UTC
timestamps (`phase_entered_at`, `queued_at`, `deadline_at`). The terminal phase is never stored;
it is derived from the terminal `semantic_jobs` row, so each job has exactly one terminal state.
Nothing is backfilled: jobs created before `0015` report no progress.

Progress rows are written through their own owner-fenced `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transactions beside
the in-memory oracle rather than through it, because a completed operation's job is not reloaded
into the oracle after restart but its terminal progress must stay readable. The insert happens
once per job and a replay never rewrites it; an update applies only when it moves
`(attempt_ordinal, phase_rank)` strictly forward for the job's active attempt of a leased job.

The automatic READY-boundary upgrade now targets schema `15` from sources `12`, `13`, and `14`,
with migration IDs `0013`–`0015` in its plan digest. A v14 bundle applies only `0015`. The v10
layout check now receives the real pending migration set rather than only the last registry
entry. Preservation comparison ignores a migration-created table only while it is empty, so an
upgrade cannot hide a populated table that the source did not have.

## Consequences

Platform wheels (not pure-Python) on macOS arm64 + manylinux_2_28 x86_64; Yoetz owns security
patching for the shipped SQLite; every dependency bump reruns the storage matrix.

## 0.3 projection query execution (#747)

Projection pages reuse an immutable exact-frontier snapshot and bounded transient row indexes.
The cache is not persisted or shared across transaction clones, and replacing the record tuple
invalidates it. Historical replay and row selection run off the event loop with no SQLite handle
or mutable ledger state in the worker. Cancellation joins the worker before returning. Query
results retain the same frontier, cursor, filtering, coverage and privacy contracts; small page
limits do not require replaying the entire ledger on every call. Lineage views retain their
existing recorded-fact semantics.

## Amendment — unreferenced captured-content abandon (2026-09-22, #571 / #550)

A captured-content object is finalized before its local manifest row commits.
`observation_content_manifests` is that object's durable owner, separate from a ledger append.
When `record_content_manifest` does not commit, or a post-finalize consent fence refuses the bind
before the write, the coordinator abandons the object this attempt just finalized through
`abandon_preappend_objects` (`observation_object_abandon_failed` if abandon itself fails). Abandon
runs only when a follow-up lookup proves the manifest row does not name that object. An unknown
lookup is not proof and leaves the object for the existing generation-fenced sweep. A committed
manifest row is never abandoned, including a pre-existing weak row whose later upsert fails.
`LIMIT_EXCEEDED` is a non-commit of the new row: the budget gap is still recorded and later parts
of that ticket are not staged, and the unowned object is abandoned rather than retained. The
24-hour orphan sweep remains the fallback. Ledger append, disclosure, and host surfaces are
unchanged. The abandon diagnostic's request id derives from the random object id, never from the
captured bytes. Residual: the lookup trusts the connection's post-rollback view, so an I/O failure
inside the SQLite commit itself, whose WAL frame a later recovery replays, could leave a row naming
an abandoned object. That row then fails verified resolution; it cannot return other bytes.
