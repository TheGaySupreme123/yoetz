# ADR-032 — Closure readiness as a checklist, and material-dependency coverage

**Status:** Proposed for [issue #913](https://github.com/TheGaySupreme123/yoetz/issues/913). The
maintainer acknowledged the design-gated scope on 2026-09-30 and adopted option 2 of the issue (the
agent-actionable / standing / acknowledged split with `ready_with_limitations`). The scoped local
verdict in the amendment below is the narrow deterministic-only exception described by issue #971;
it does not change the receipt conclusion or suppress coverage. Decisions 1–5
are implemented. Decisions 6 and 7 are recorded here as the direction the issue recommends; the
single status coverage definition of decision 7 is implemented, and the rest of 6 and 7 is tracked
on the issue.
**Implemented by:** `src/yoetz/kernel/closure_readiness.py`, `src/yoetz/application/status.py`,
`src/yoetz/adapters/memory/ledger.py`, `src/yoetz/protocol/models.py`,
`src/yoetz/protocol/readiness_text.py`, `src/yoetz/mcp/summaries.py`, `src/yoetz/cli/render.py`,
`src/yoetz/tui/`, the status-result 1.4.0 schema, and the shipped guidance and skills.
**Relates to:** ADR-019 (declared completion scope), ADR-020 (typed evidence digest provenance),
ADR-027 (task lineage), ADR-030 (typed recovery directives), and issues #904, #905, #910, #911,
#912, #917, #971.

## Context

In all 58 Yoetz sessions of the DeepSWE v2 benchmark, `closure_readiness.blocking_conditions`
contained `coverage_gaps_declared`, and in 36 of them it was the only condition. The condition was
appended whenever the page carried any gap. Every Codex session carries standing gaps
(`host_outcome_unavailable`, `unpaired_event`), and a local-only check always adds
`semantic_review_not_requested`, so readiness could never say "you are done". Agents could not tell
work remaining from a limitation their host always has; they rechecked unchanged state, or stopped
without a checklist end state.

The verdict in that lane is honest and stays: a local-only check with gaps is
`insufficient_coverage`. What was missing is a stop signal that says the agent is finished and
names what the receipt will disclose.

## Decisions

1. **Readiness is a checklist.** Every `status` view carries, beside the unchanged
   `blocking_conditions`, a `state` and three groups:
   - `agent_actionable`: what the agent can still do — `obligations_open`, `findings_unanswered`,
     an unacknowledged `receipt_findings_unresolved`, `no_plan_published`,
     `no_obligations_declared`, `projection_stale`, `check_in_progress` (a check holds the session
     frontier; its result is still to come), `check_not_recorded` or `check_not_applicable` (the
     receipt's own applicability rule: run a check after the material change), and every gap code
     the table classifies as actionable;
   - `standing_limitations`: gap codes no available agent action removes under the current host,
     profile and privacy policy; they are disclosed on the receipt, never instructions;
   - `acknowledged_not_done`: obligations and findings the agent recorded as not done, with a
     reason (ids, bounded to 64, plus `acknowledged_not_done_count`).

   `state` is `action_required` while `agent_actionable` is non-empty, `ready_with_limitations`
   when it is empty and something is standing or acknowledged, `ready` when nothing remains at
   all, and `unknown` exactly when readiness itself is unknown (`readiness_unknown`).
   `blocking_conditions` keeps naming everything that bounds the conclusion, so
   `coverage_gaps_declared` remains, now as disclosure; nothing is filtered or suppressed.

2. **A closed, versioned classification table.** `yoetz.kernel.closure_readiness` assigns every gap
   code the product emits exactly once to `agent_actionable` or `standing_limitation`, and
   `gap_classification_version` (currently `"2"`) names the table that classified a response. The
   classification test: a code is standing when no agent action available under the current host,
   profile and privacy policy removes it; it is actionable when a documented agent action (publish,
   respond, revise a claim or plan, recheck after a material change, re-read status once the
   service catches up) removes it. Disclosure codes that describe the bounds of a review, a
   deliberate selection or a capture failure are standing. Of the 20 codes observed in the v2
   evidence only `completion_plan_not_claimed` is unconditionally actionable.

3. **Build-time completeness, runtime conservatism.** A conformance test enumerates every gap-code
   producer — `ObservationGapCode`, `CoordinationGapCode`, the `*_GAP` constants,
   `semantic_coverage_gap_code` outputs, the channel baselines, the lineage manifest template, and a
   syntax-tree scan of gap-sink literals across `src/yoetz` (deterministic-check, command-attempt,
   receipt, lineage, observation and import producers) — and fails when one emits an unclassified
   code or the table names a code nothing emits. Prefixed forms (`coverage:<code>`,
   `check_coverage:<code>`, `retained_finding_coverage:<code>`, `semantic_outcome:<code>`,
   `lineage:<code>:…`) classify by their base code. A code the running build does not know — for
   example one read from a ledger a newer build wrote — is reported as `unclassified_gap:<code>` in
   `agent_actionable`, so the conservative default is visible and never reads as done.

4. **One route-dependent code.** `semantic_review_not_requested` is standing on a route where
   AI-powered review is optional or disabled. It is actionable only when the effective verification
   policy requires AI-powered review, the serving route can dispatch it, and no check whose
   AI-powered review succeeded has been recorded without a later material change (remedy: run it).
   A strict MCP route never dispatches AI-powered review (ADR-018), so a status read served by it
   classifies the code as standing even under a `required` policy: the remedy is the owner's
   (serve the policy route), and asking the agent for an impossible check would recreate the
   unchanged-state recheck loop. Status callers without a route (CLI, terminal interface, closure
   preparation) check on the policy route and keep the policy-derived rule. The same session can
   therefore read `ready_with_limitations` to an agent on a strict MCP connection and
   `action_required` in the CLI or terminal interface. That is coherent, not a contradiction:
   readiness answers "what can *this* caller still do", and the CLI can run the required review on
   the policy route while the strict process cannot. The ledger, `known_gaps`, the verdict and the
   receipt are identical on both.

5. **Derived per request; no verdict changes.** Readiness is derived from the compact projection and
   the recorded prefix at the requested frontier on every read, never cached across frontiers and
   never recorded. A restart, a reattach or an upgrade over a ledger written by an older build
   recomputes it without migrating any event, and old receipts keep their recorded wording.
   Readiness facts that an adapter cannot derive make readiness `unknown`, never a stop state.
   `standing_limitations` promises disclosure on the receipt, so it holds only recorded gaps: a live
   lineage token from status's catalog comparison that no recorded evaluation carries yet stays
   agent-actionable, because a receipt folds recorded lineage only.
   Classification never removes a code from `known_gaps`, never changes a check verdict or receipt
   conclusion, and never strengthens coverage. The frozen directive for each state lives in
   `yoetz.protocol.readiness_text`; the `ready_with_limitations` sentence is the owner-approved
   "Nothing further to do. N standing limitation(s) and M acknowledged item(s) will be disclosed on
   the receipt. Request the receipt." MCP text, the CLI and the terminal interface render it from
   the state token and service counts, in ADR-030's directive style. No readiness state is rendered
   as verified: the terminal interface never uses its verified glyph for any of them.

6. **Acknowledged, not done (direction).** Findings use the `acknowledged_not_done` `respond`
   disposition defined by #905, with its required reason; readiness reads a finding's latest
   response disposition by value, so no second finding mechanism exists. Obligations get the
   explicit form owned by #913: an obligation-level disposition published through `publish_work`
   with the same name and a required short reason. An acknowledged obligation leaves
   `obligations_open` and joins `acknowledged_not_done`; it is terminal — a later completion is a
   new linked item, and the receipt shows both. One receipt section, "Acknowledged, not done",
   lists each item with its reason; it is never folded into a pass or counted as resolved.

7. **Material-dependency coverage (direction).** A *material dependency* of a conclusion is the
   closure of the effective completion claims' `supporting_refs`, the resolved obligations'
   `resolution_evidence_refs`, and the results and evidence those references name. Receipt and
   completion coverage fold `weakest()` over that closure rather than over every projection record.
   Service-verified capture (an `observation_captured` digest with `immutable_snapshot` strength and
   a `captured_object_id`) may raise `evidence_immutability` and `artifact_observation` for the
   evidence it backs, never caller-declared strength. `ledger_freshness` derives from real
   freshness facts (lag, staleness after a material change, redaction, unknown events), not from
   the presence of a gap, and every gap stays in `known_gaps`. Page-level and task-level coverage
   are either unified or named distinctly. *Implemented part:* status reports one definition —
every projection view's envelope `coverage` and `gaps` are the compact task coverage, so a results
or history view can no longer read `service_authenticated / current / 0 gaps` beside a partial
task. The closure fold, capture-raised strength and fact-derived freshness remain open on the
issue.

## Consequences

- An agent whose remaining conditions are all standing reads `ready_with_limitations`, requests the
  receipt and stops; the receipt still says `insufficient_coverage` and lists every gap.
- A new gap code cannot ship unclassified, and an unknown code keeps the task actionable rather than
  hiding behind a stop state.
- The unreleased status-result 1.4.0 schema is edited in place: the checklist fields are optional
  on the wire, so a result shaped by an earlier 0.3 build still validates, but when present they
  are complete, and this build emits them on every status success. Guidance, every host skill and
  the status tool description name the stop signal.
- A standing set differs per host; each host runbook records its own.

## Alternatives rejected

- **Suppress `coverage_gaps_declared` when every gap is structural.** It hides limitations instead
  of classifying them.
- **Tolerate structural gaps in the check verdict.** It would let `no_issue_detected` and
  `no_unresolved_deterministic_findings` describe work whose record was only consistent.
- **Guidance that tells agents to ignore `coverage_gaps_declared`.** The product must classify, not
  the prompt.
- **An open-ended heuristic.** A closed table can be reviewed per host and tested for completeness.

## Amendment — bounded deterministic-only scoped verdict (2026-10-04, #971)

The earlier option-3 rejection applies to treating standing coverage as permission to call the
whole task clean. Issue #971 adopts a narrower result for a check whose effective mode is
`deterministic_only` (including an omitted mode resolved by a disabled verification policy):
`no_issue_detected` may describe the deterministic rules within that check's recorded scope when
the frozen totals show no open or unreadable obligation, no unattempted requested item, no unknown
or relevant live observed failure, and no actionable finding, including one that the public finding
cap would suppress. The internal ranking state is `scoped_complete`; it does not add a wire verdict
token.

The allowlist is closed to `semantic_review_not_requested`, plan-drift advisory codes, and the
informational pre-existing-test-edit codes. Any other gap, an actionable finding, or a blocking
total keeps the ordinary `insufficient_coverage` or `action_required` result. Every gap remains in
the check coverage, status and receipt. The receipt therefore continues to say that AI-powered
review did not run and retains its coverage-bounded conclusion; a scoped local verdict never means
that the work is correct or that a provider reviewed it. Non-deterministic modes retain the prior
completeness rules.

## Amendment — completion needs an answerable signal (2026-10-05, TB4 pilot)

**Context.** In the Terminal-Bench 4 pilot (Yoetz `d925fe46`, Codex), an agent missed a stated
requirement, resolved three coarse self-written obligations with one shared bundle of its own
evidence, and reached a receipt. The one relevant signal, `instruction_requirement_unmapped`, fired
on all six Yoetz attempts but was a standing advisory, so nothing asked the agent to answer it. The
maintainer requested these changes on 2026-10-05 (design-gated: check outcomes and closure).

**Decisions.** Both rules are structural: they read recorded relations and closed host-derived
tokens, never the statement, plan, obligation or command prose.

1. *Unmapped task statement.* `instruction_requirement_unmapped` is reclassified from standing to
   `agent_actionable` (`plan_unrefined_before_first_edit` and
   `obligation_evidence_stale_after_scope_edit` stay standing; `PLAN_DRIFT_ADVISORY_GAPS` names
   them). Every whole-case check also raises a local `task_requirement_unmet` finding
   (research-evidence identity, fact `task_statement_unmapped`, missing fact
   `statement_sourced_obligation_absent`) whose single subject is the current statement event,
   while a task statement is recorded and the effective plan declares obligations of which none
   cites that event in `source_refs`. The finding text names the event id and the repair: publish
   statement-sourced obligations with `plan_revised`. No statement, an unreadable or absent plan,
   and an explicit empty-scope declaration keep their earlier behaviour. The gap no longer counts as
   advisory for check completeness, the scoped deterministic verdict, or the receipt conclusion.
2. *Uncorroborated completion.* The work-integrity rule `claim_without_admissible_evidence` gains
   a second trigger (facts `observed_verification_uncited` / `observed_verification_absent`): an
   effective completion claim whose support chain (`supporting_refs`, `limitation_refs`, and the
   resolution evidence of the obligations it names) cites no hook-observed verification result
   recorded after the latest hook-observed edit. A verification result is a service-stamped
   observed command result with a recorded outcome whose host runner class is not `exploration`
   or `vcs`; hook-captured evidence (native tool output) and evidence a verification result links
   count at their own frontier. The rule is silent when hooks observed neither an edit nor a verification run (captured
   evidence alone corroborates but never makes it apply), so a
   host without hooks keeps its coverage disclosure instead of an unanswerable finding. Repair:
   replace the claim citing the observed `res_` id from `status view=results`.
3. *Test-edit justification.* An edit to a pre-existing test file is also justified when an
   effective obligation citing the statement event lists the file as a `requested_items` entry with
   `item_kind` `file` (exact repository-relative path, `./` form, absolute path ending in the
   path, or its digest). The decision marker remains accepted.

**Consequences.** A check rerun with no new events returns these findings again; `respond` answers
but never resolves them, and the receipt keeps `unresolved_findings_remain` until a later check
proves them absent. The rules check presence of a link, not adequacy: one statement-sourced
obligation clears the first rule however coarse the plan, and any observed non-exploration run
after the last edit clears the second. They make an unmapped request or an uncorroborated claim
visible and answerable; they do not prove the work correct. Both fired on every deterministic
pilot attempt, including the two that passed the hidden tests, because no agent cited the
statement or an observed run; the guidance now asks for both from the start. A persisted check
replays through the text-contract digest.

**Versions (maintainer-approved 2026-10-05).** Check results produced under these rules carry new
identifiers: `research-evidence` and `work-integrity` move to `0.2.0` (`coordination` stays
`0.1.0`), and `gap_classification_version` moves to `"2"` (the reclassification in decision 1 and
the earlier standing classification of `compound_outcome_unavailable`). New checks run and select
only the current pack versions. Earlier identities stay readable: recorded checks and findings,
check results replayed from the ledger, and results an earlier 0.3 service shaped keep `0.1.0` or
`"1"`, and the active 0.3 contracts admit both. A pack's versions form one lineage, so the finding
issue key names the pack without its version and a later check at the same or a newer version can
resolve a finding recorded before the upgrade. `docs/INTERFACES.md` records the contract details.
