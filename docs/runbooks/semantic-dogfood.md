# Semantic dogfood runbook

This runbook governs sessions that use Yoetz on Yoetz and then report a finding about it. Its
purpose is to fix, **before** the first task action, which claim the run is allowed to make — so a
result is never read as evidence for a question the run's configuration made unanswerable.

It exists because of the 2026-08-03 postmortem
([`docs/postmortems/2026-08-03-codex-testing-yoetz-schema-feedback-influence.md`](../postmortems/2026-08-03-codex-testing-yoetz-schema-feedback-influence.md)),
which scored "did semantic feedback help?" against a session whose MCP route was `strict`. Yoetz
behaved correctly and reported honestly — `semantic_status=blocked_by_policy`,
`semantic_reason=route_semantic_ceiling`, `semantic_provenance: null`, zero egress. The run simply
could never have measured semantic usefulness. Nothing in the tooling said so in advance.

Three facts this runbook keeps apart:

- **Registration is not activation.** A registered MCP entry says what Codex would launch, not that
  it launched or that a model was shown anything.
- **Availability is not usefulness.** A route that *can* dispatch semantic review is not evidence
  that the review helped.
- **A clean semantic judgment is not proof the implementation is correct.**

## 1. Pick the profile before you start

Choose one profile and record it. Do not switch profiles mid-run; a run that changes route posture
partway through has no single claim it can make.

### Profile A — strict / local-only

**Preconditions:** `mcp_route.observed == true` **and** `registered_profile == "strict"`.

Both halves are required. An unread route (`observed: false`) reports `registered_profile: null`,
which is *unknown*, not *strict* — it is no basis for a zero-egress claim. Observation is also what
separates a strict route from `absent` or `foreign_present`, which report `registered_profile: null`
with `observed: true` and are likewise not Profile A.

Claims this run may make:

- zero external semantic egress through the Yoetz agent route
- deterministic-check behaviour
- receipt honesty — that the refusal is recorded with the exact status/reason and no promoted
  deterministic outcome

Claims this run may **not** make: anything about semantic quality, usefulness, or influence.
Record semantic usefulness as **not tested**. Never record it as "poor", "weak", or "absent" — the
route declined to attempt it, which is not a measurement of it.

### Profile B — policy-enabled

**Preconditions, all three:**

1. `registered_profile == "policy"`
2. `agent_route_semantic_ready == true`
3. human authorization obtained through the existing ceremony — either the API credential
   ceremony (`yoetz provider credential set`) or the Codex-managed subscription setup — with the
   privacy policy already in place before the run starts

Claims this run may make: everything in Profile A, plus observations about semantic output, subject
to the provenance gate in §3.

Explicitly: previewing a registration change from inside the session is allowed
(`yoetz integrate codex mcp preview`). **Widening privacy policy from the agent channel is not.**
Policy widening is a human ceremony; if a run finds it needs wider policy, the run stops and is
re-planned, it does not widen and continue.

## 2. Preflight sequence

For Codex runs launched from a disposable worktree, first complete the stricter
[Codex dogfood parity preflight](codex-dogfood.md). Its exact-worktree activation, consent, host
delivery, observation, and rollback cells are not implied by the five semantic checks below.

Run all five before the first task action and record the output verbatim. Every command here is
read-only and already exists — this runbook adds no command.

```text
yoetz version
yoetz service status
yoetz provider status --json
yoetz integrate codex mcp status --json
yoetz privacy show
```

Fields to record from `yoetz provider status --json`:

| Field | What it settles |
|---|---|
| `semantic_ready` | Whether **this installation** can dispatch semantic review at all. Installation-local; unchanged by route posture. |
| `mcp_route.registered_profile` | Which route the Codex agent actually gets: `policy`, `strict`, or `null` when unread. |
| `mcp_route.configured_profile` | Which route setup would register now. |
| `mcp_route.observed` | `false` means the route could not be read — **not** that none is registered. |
| `agent_route_semantic_ready` | Whether the **registered Codex route** can dispatch semantic review. This is the field that selects the profile. |
| `endpoint.role`, `fallback_endpoint` | Which bound endpoint is the primary and whether a fallback is declared (issue #582). `fallback_endpoint` absent means a single-endpoint install; when present, record both identities (provider, model, endpoint profile) — a later `fallback_from` in provenance must match. |
| `fallback_credential_connected` | Presence-only credential state of the fallback (`true` / `false` / `null` when unknown), mirrored by the `fallback_provider_credential` blocker. It never moves `semantic_ready`: a primary can be ready while its fallback is not, and vice versa. |

`registered_profile != configured_profile` is registration drift: the registered entry no longer
matches what this installation's configuration would produce. Record it and resolve it before
starting, through a fresh digest-bound re-registration — `yoetz integrate codex mcp preview`, then
`yoetz integrate codex mcp install --accept --preview-digest <digest>` (ADR-018 decision 7). Do not
assume the configured value is what the agent will get.

A second, independent drift signal compares the live registration against the last applied
install rather than current configuration (issue #537). `yoetz provider status --json`
`mcp_route` carries `applied_profile` (the route the installer last applied, from the
state-root record) and `drift_since_install` (true when the live observed registration
disagrees with it). Record both at preflight alongside the table above. A ceiling check
served while the applied record says `policy` additionally carries the
`optional_semantic_review_registration_drift` coverage gap next to the ceiling gap, and its
receipt names the recovery: re-run `mcp preview` / `mcp install --route-profile policy` and
start a fresh Codex process. The MCP bridge emits a closed `registration_drift` hook
diagnostic under the `mcp_serve` event when the route it starts on disagrees with the applied
record, so read `hook_diagnostics.reasons` there too — a drift that appears mid-session
invalidates the profile the run declared in §1. The hook events themselves emit nothing here:
they have no serving route to compare, and probing the host from a hook costs more than the
hook budget allows.

`mcp_route.observed: false` is disqualifying for **both** profiles. An unread route is not a policy
route, and it is not a strict route either — it is no route at all until it is read.

`yoetz integrate codex mcp status --json` reports `route_profile` alongside `registered_profile`,
`applied_profile`, and `drift_since_install` for the same reason, and is the narrower check when
you only need the route and its post-install drift.

### Pairing a fallback endpoint

Since issue #582 the two external authorities — an API provider and the Codex ChatGPT
subscription evaluator — may be bound together as one primary plus exactly one fallback. The
commands below mutate configuration and policy; run them before the five read-only checks, never
mid-run, and treat the policy step as the human ceremony it is.

Subscription primary, API provider as fallback:

```text
yoetz provider codex-subscription setup --executable /absolute/path/to/codex   # if not bound yet
yoetz provider endpoint --provider <preset> --model <model-id> --as-fallback
yoetz provider credential set                                                 # fallback's API key
yoetz privacy setup                                                           # approve both destinations
```

API provider primary, subscription as fallback:

```text
yoetz provider endpoint --provider <preset> --model <model-id>                # if not bound yet
yoetz provider credential set
yoetz provider codex-subscription setup --executable /absolute/path/to/codex --as-fallback
yoetz privacy setup                                                           # approve both destinations
```

`--as-fallback` refuses (`semantic_fallback_endpoint_missing`) unless the other authority is
already bound; without the flag the ordinary single-endpoint rule replaces the existing binding.
The result reports `endpoint_role`, and `config.toml` gains a nonsecret `[semantic_fallback]`
table whose `primary` is `codex_subscription` or `api_provider`. Two API providers cannot pair.

Binding the fallback does not authorize it. `yoetz privacy setup` reads both endpoints and prints
the second as `Fallback destination (after the primary cannot serve)`; committing it is a
widening of exactly one more destination, shown in the trusted `before -> after` view as
`Fallback provider and model` right after the primary row, and goes through the ordinary
propose → decide ceremony. Until that decision, egress admits the primary only. Record the
committed `yoetz privacy show` output at preflight so a fallback-served attempt can be matched
against the approved set.

Reverse and swap:

```text
yoetz provider fallback remove                       # primary keeps serving alone
yoetz provider fallback primary api_provider          # or codex_subscription: swap roles, both kept
yoetz provider codex-subscription disconnect --accept # inside a pairing: API provider becomes sole endpoint
```

`fallback remove` restores the exact single-endpoint `config.toml`; the policy still names the
removed destination until `yoetz privacy setup` is re-run, which is a tightening and needs no
widening ceremony. A swap keeps both bindings and both approvals.

What engages the fallback is closed and service-side, identical on every host: the primary is
abandoned only after two `provider_timeout` / `transport_unavailable` / `provider_rate_limited`
failures, one `provider_quota_exhausted`, an exhausted primary retry budget, or a primary that
could not be resolved before dispatch (`credential_unavailable`). Content-shaped outcomes
(`response_content_invalid`, `response_schema_invalid`, `refused`,
`semantic_judgment_rejected`), policy or human outcomes, and `outcome_unknown` stay with the
primary. Each endpoint keeps its own retry budget and timeout, and each fallback attempt is a
fresh physical attempt with its own authorization and privacy receipt — under
`confirm_every_request` that means its own foreground decision.

**Caveat (issue #584).** A Codex subscription quota exhaustion is currently mis-parsed as
`invalid/response_schema_invalid`, which is content-shaped and never licenses the fallback. Until
#584 is fixed, a subscription primary that runs out of quota does **not** hand the case to its
API-provider fallback; record such a run as a primary failure with no fallback attempt, not as a
fallback defect.

## 3. The provenance gate

Whether a run may score semantic usefulness is derived from the check result, never asserted from
configuration. The rule is protocol-enforced by `validate_semantic_provenance_binding`
(`src/yoetz/protocol/models.py`) and its totality is locked by test.

**Read provenance together with `semantic_status` and `semantic_reason` — never alone.** Null
provenance means *no provider attempt was made* only on the branches where the protocol forbids
provenance (rows 1 and 3 below). `failed` is unconstrained: it may carry provenance or not, and
either way the attempt is indeterminate. Nor does the converse hold — provenance being *present*
proves an attempt happened, not that it was useful.

| `semantic_status` | `semantic_provenance` | May score semantic usefulness |
|---|---|---|
| any pre-dispatch status — `not_requested`, `not_configured`, `blocked_by_policy` (incl. `route_semantic_ceiling`), `blocked_forbidden_data`, `classification_uncertain`, `awaiting_human`, `human_denied`, `approval_expired` | `null` (enforced) | **No** — not attempted |
| `succeeded`, `refused`, `timeout`, `invalid`, `late`, `stale`; or `unavailable` with `transport_unavailable` / `provider_rate_limited` / `provider_quota_exhausted` / `outcome_unknown` | present (enforced) | Yes; `outcome_unknown` proves an acknowledged attempt, not its outcome or usefulness |
| `unavailable` with `credential_unavailable`, `endpoint_profile_unavailable`, `retry_budget_exhausted`, `audit_reservation_unavailable`, `receipt_persistence_unknown` | `null` (enforced) | **No** — not attempted |
| `failed` / `coordinator_failure` | either — unconstrained | **No** — attempt indeterminate |
| any row above whose attempt the **declared fallback** served | present, with `fallback_from` naming the primary's provider/endpoint/model, its `attempted_count` before engagement, and its closed `reason`; the top-level provider/model/endpoint name the fallback | Same as the row it lands in, scored **against the endpoint that served**. Record the primary's `fallback_from.reason` as a separate primary-failure cell, never as the fallback's outcome |

`failed` is the one status where provenance presence proves nothing in either direction. Record it
as **attempt indeterminate**, never as "not attempted".

With a declared fallback (issue #582), `fallback_from` on the provenance is what says the
fallback served; its absence on a present provenance means the primary served, whatever the
pairing. Match the top-level identity against the `fallback_endpoint` recorded at preflight and
the approved policy before scoring, and report the run as two cells — the primary's closed
failure and the fallback's outcome. A fallback-served `succeeded` proves an attempt at the
fallback, not that the primary's failure reason was correctly classified (see the #584 caveat in
§2). The JSON receipt carries the same `fallback_from`; the markdown and text receipts name the
endpoint that served and the primary's closed failure reason.

Read the gate off the result, not off preflight. Passing preflight makes an attempt *possible*; only
the result says whether one *happened*.

## 4. What passing preflight does not prove

- It does not prove a semantic review ran. That is the gate in §3.
- It does not prove the review was useful. Availability is not usefulness.
- It does not prove the implementation under review is correct. A clean semantic judgment is one
  observation, not a verdict.
- It does not measure whether feedback changed the agent's behaviour. Influence measurement is
  governed by the [influence dogfood runbook](influence-dogfood.md) (issue
  [#133](https://github.com/TheGaySupreme123/yoetz/issues/133)): four separate evidence streams,
  seeded-defect and miss taxonomy, and a forbidden-summary rule so zero influence cannot be sold as
  improvement.

## 5. Report hygiene

A dogfood report is shared material. It carries:

- credential state as **presence only** (`connected` / `not stored` / `unknown`) — never a value,
  prefix, length, or any property of the stored secret
- no absolute paths, usernames, or machine identifiers
- no transcripts
- no unredacted provider request or response payloads
- versions, bounded status/reason tokens, digests, and structural state

Report the declared profile, the preflight output, the resulting `semantic_status` /
`semantic_reason` / provenance presence, and the gate row those land in. State the claim the run was
authorized to make and stop there.
