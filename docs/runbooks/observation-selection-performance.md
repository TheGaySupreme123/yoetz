# Observation selection performance baseline

This runbook records the public safe baseline used for issue #687. It is a
measurement of the observation boundary at revision
`e56f7d0a873281ea05c95a0bcb8eb348d65cce4a` on `codex/repair-host-observation`.
It is not an acceptance result for the selection implementation.

The workload is deterministic and synthetic. It uses eight host session lanes,
paired `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` hook events, successful routine reads,
failures, denials, cancellation, a mutation, a negative verification, retry
and recovery, ambiguous shell work, and Yoetz closure reads. Payloads contain
only fixed labels and digests. The run uses an owner only state directory under
`/private/tmp`; it starts no service, opens no vault, reads no session corpus,
and performs no native content capture. The capture column is therefore an
eligible content byte estimate, not captured content or a provenance result.

The exact JSON outputs are retained as local operator evidence outside the
repository. The committed replay harness is
[benchmark_observation_selection.py](../../scripts/benchmark_observation_selection.py).
To replay against the exact baseline source, point the harness from a checkout
that contains the script at a separate clean checkout whose `HEAD` is the
baseline revision. Binding `PYTHONPATH` to the clean checkout prevents the
working tree's implementation modules from being imported:

```text
BASELINE_CHECKOUT=/path/to/clean/e56f7d0a873281ea05c95a0bcb8eb348d65cce4a
HARNESS_CHECKOUT=/path/to/checkout/with/benchmark
PYTHONPATH="$BASELINE_CHECKOUT/src" UV_CACHE_DIR=<task-cache> \
  uv run --project "$BASELINE_CHECKOUT" python \
  "$HARNESS_CHECKOUT/scripts/benchmark_observation_selection.py" \
  --revision e56f7d0a873281ea05c95a0bcb8eb348d65cce4a \
  --checkout "$BASELINE_CHECKOUT" \
  --counts 512 2048 8192 --fanout 8
```

The table below was captured before the implementation worktree changed by a
temporary public safe replay with the same count and fanout shape; its command
and full JSON files are listed in the local evidence manifest. A 512 event
cross check with the committed harness against the same clean revision is
retained separately because that harness includes additional protected classes
and the production envelope mapper. Do not mix those two report shapes when
comparing timings or serialized byte totals.

## Baseline measurements

The current revision has a 512 row outbox limit, a 1,048,576 byte serialized
workspace state limit, a 256 open pre event limit, and a 256 retained envelope
limit. The SQLite capture ticket limit is independent and was not exercised by
this structural only replay.

| Hook events | Spool bytes | Outbox admitted | Outbox overflow | Final state bytes | State writes | Serialized bytes written | Encode time | Peak RSS (MB) |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 512 | 197,554 | 488 | 0 | 666,754 | 512 | 196,623,474 | 22.93 s | 37.1 |
| 2,048 | 790,686 | 512 | 1,434 | 802,311 | 2,048 | 1,341,202,265 | 98.09 s | 48.4 |
| 8,192 | 3,163,186 | 512 | 7,272 | 954,623 | 8,192 | 7,046,911,597 | 417.43 s | 43.7 |

The 488 rows at 512 and the overflow counts at larger workloads account for
successful Yoetz status reads being suppressed by the existing self observation
delivery filter. All envelopes were locally accepted in these runs, while the
retained envelope view remained capped at 256. A full or empty outbox therefore
does not describe the upstream write or retention cost.

The observed hook append p50/p95/p99 latencies were 0.140/0.183/0.258 ms,
0.153/0.241/0.460 ms, and 0.160/0.256/0.430 ms for 512, 2,048, and 8,192
events. Local ingest p50/p95/p99 were 0.246/0.394/0.623 ms,
0.288/0.530/0.965 ms, and 0.336/0.590/0.912 ms. The outbox timing includes
both projected state encoding and full queue rejection: its p50/p95/p99 were
24.205/44.121/49.636 ms at 512, 0.054/39.063/54.257 ms at 2,048, and
0.089/14.023/39.596 ms at 8,192. The mixed full cap timings must not be read as
a throughput improvement.

The dominant sustainable constraint is repeated whole state serialization. The
average serialized bytes per attempted event rose from about 384 KiB at 512 to
655 KiB at 2,048 and 860 KiB at 8,192, even though the final state stayed below
the one MiB ceiling. Raising the queue target alone would preserve this write
amplification and would still leave the independent capture ticket budget
unchanged.

An unpinned working tree spot check, captured before the final protected-retry
replay shape was added, is a regression signal rather than an acceptance
result. Its Focused/512 case reduced pending rows from 482 to 348, but increased
cumulative serialized bytes from 196.8 MB to 254.6 MB and outbox p99 from 37.2
ms to 177.3 ms. The selected path also raised final state from 666.7 KiB to
838.3 KiB. These values must be rerun after the implementation is committed;
they do not establish a shipped performance target.

## Provisional budget proposals

These are engineering targets derived from the baseline, not measured
post-change results:

* Keep Focused/512 as the only default. Treat 2,048 and 8,192 as candidate
  profiles until an append oriented or sidecar representation demonstrates
  bounded serialized bytes, pending pair state, capture ticket occupancy, and
  control plane responsiveness.
* Preserve at least 25% of the one MiB state ceiling for authority, loss, and
  transition accounting. A selected admission path should therefore trigger
  reduction before approximately 786 KiB, while retaining protected records
  and reporting the pressure dimension.
* In the same synthetic environment, keep hook append p99 at or below 1 ms and
  local ingest p99 at or below 2 ms. These are regression guards for this
  harness, not host wide latency guarantees.
* Report cumulative serialized bytes and write count alongside admitted rows.
  A lower ledger row count is insufficient evidence when upstream envelopes,
  capture work, or rejection accounting still incur the same writes.
* Measure the independent 512 capture ticket budget and captured content bytes
  before advertising any larger capacity. This structural harness does not
  establish that budget.

After implementation, rerun the same workload for all six Focused/Detailed and
512/2,048/8,192 combinations. Record selected versus effective settings,
summary input counts, protected individual deliveries, capture extraction
attempts, replayable rejection accounting, and the same timing and serialized
byte fields. Do not fill this baseline table with those results until they are
actually measured at a pinned revision.

## Coverage limits

This baseline exercises the Codex shaped local hook spool and local observation
store in one process. It does not prove Claude Code or Cursor hook behavior,
service RPC drain throughput, SQLite capture ticket exhaustion, native encrypted
capture, restart or crash recovery, concurrent workspace writers, semantic
review, or receipt coverage. The eligible content byte estimate is not evidence
that content was captured, delivered, selected for a check, or available for a
receipt.

## Concurrent host-adapter repair probe (#689–#691)

The separate [hook probe](../../scripts/benchmark_observation_hooks.py) runs eight
concurrent processes against one fresh owner-only store. It invokes the Codex,
Claude Code and Cursor adapters with synthetic pre-tool events, using their native
payload shapes. The retained fixture begins with 250 envelopes, 60 pending rows
and 199 quarantined rows (approximately 366 KiB). Interpreter startup is excluded;
Codex's stream-module cold import inside the adapter is included. No service,
vault, vendor host, transcript corpus or native content capture is involved.

On 2026-09-10, the same harness compared source baseline
`f98d6d6315141e6b07f3cf38c6fd566dfc4fd584` with an independent installed wheel built
from clean revision `55c81ed1ae6f10878f6c6ea4aaee86bfa3189428`. The wheel digest was
`sha256:028da76beaaa4e0a8c3c99fbcf981fa372f0d18268dbb4e69f1ce5bdc7a8096e`.
Times below are milliseconds, rounded to the nearest millisecond. With eight
samples, nearest-rank p95 and p99 both equal the maximum; this small probe cannot
establish tail latency or a host deadline guarantee.

| Adapter | Baseline retained p50 / p95 / p99 / max | Installed retained p50 / p95 / p99 / max | Installed fresh p50 / p95 / p99 / max | Baseline / installed retained inputs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | 2002 / 3316 / 3316 / 3316 | 825 / 1338 / 1338 / 1338 | 398 / 484 / 484 / 484 | 7/8 / 8/8 |
| Claude Code | 1223 / 1888 / 1888 / 1888 | 560 / 1060 / 1060 / 1060 | 50 / 114 / 114 / 114 | 8/8 / 8/8 |
| Cursor | 1348 / 1980 / 1980 / 1980 | 473 / 971 / 971 / 971 | 48 / 120 / 120 / 120 | 8/8 / 8/8 |

Every installed retained run ended with 68 pending and the original 199
quarantined rows; every fresh run ended with eight pending and zero quarantine.
All eight supplied identities were retained, with zero unaccounted inputs and
zero new recorded loss. Delivered inputs were zero because RPC was disabled.
The baseline Codex run returned neutral success for one input that never reached
admission accounting; its 2002 ms rejection is included in the baseline timing,
not counted as successful throughput. The JSON report separates retained and
not-retained invocation times and reports accounting before and after.

To reproduce the installed side from a checkout containing this harness:

```text
uv run python scripts/provision_test_instance.py create \
  --base "$HOME/.yz-instances" --tag obs689 --lifecycle disposable --expires-in 8 \
  --revision 55c81ed1ae6f10878f6c6ea4aaee86bfa3189428

env -u YOETZ_ISOLATED_ROOT "$HOME/.yz-instances/obs689/runtime/bin/python" \
  scripts/benchmark_observation_hooks.py --fanout 8 --retained
env -u YOETZ_ISOLATED_ROOT "$HOME/.yz-instances/obs689/runtime/bin/python" \
  scripts/benchmark_observation_hooks.py --fanout 8
```

The retention regression separately compares final encoded bytes against the
original linear eviction algorithm for 700 envelopes, 176 pending rows and 700
quarantine entries. It requires at most 16 full encodes and retains all 176
pending identities after reopening. Logical-clock tests cover hard-pressure
recovery, accepted-buffer transfers, projected aggregate bytes and ended-session
generation fences. Control-failure tests cover all four sources (the three hook
sources plus Codex session streams), bounded retries, connection stop, retained
replay identity and rotated payload-free diagnostics.

These are implementation and adapter results. They do not complete the issues'
real vendor-host parent/delegate workload, encrypted capture, fresh native
control-rejection trace, upgrade over a running older service, or the six larger
profile combinations described above. The fix removes repeated retention encodes
and repeated batch preflight, moves Codex cold preparation outside the store
lock, and shares the elapsed drain budget. Connection setup may use its reserved
preflight allowance after subtracting snapshot time; service calls retain the
original drain deadline, so a slow connection cannot reset it. It does not replace the JSON store
with an append-oriented representation, interrupt synchronous durable writes,
or establish an end-to-end timeout guarantee. Historical quarantine cannot be
attributed from the new diagnostic format. Keep those acceptance limits visible
when assessing the linked PR.
