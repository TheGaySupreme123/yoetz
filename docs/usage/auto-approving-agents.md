# Auto-approving an MCP route

Auto-approval should be based on the exact process a host launches, not on an assumption about the
current provider or privacy configuration.

For a Yoetz MCP process that must never request external semantic review, register:

```text
yoetz mcp serve --semantic off
```

This starts the **strict** route profile. For that process lifetime:

- deterministic checks and all six Yoetz workflow operations remain available;
- `check` never requests semantic runtime capability and never dispatches a semantic evaluator;
- a semantic request is recorded as `blocked_by_policy` / `route_semantic_ceiling`;
- `semantic_required` is incomplete and the result and receipt retain the coverage gap;
- `check.openWorldHint` is `false`, and initialize plus `status(view=versions)` disclose `strict`.

The route profile is not an agent request field and cannot be changed over MCP. The descriptor is
an inspectable hint; the application route constraint is the enforcement.

## What strict does not claim

Strict is an external-semantic egress ceiling, not a general-purpose sandbox and not a promise that
the process opens no communication channels. The MCP bridge still uses the approved local Yoetz
service IPC. It does not constrain the host agent, the operating system, separately running local
models, or unrelated processes.

The ordinary command remains:

```text
yoetz mcp serve
```

That starts the **policy** route. Semantic review can occur only when the durable privacy policy,
provider readiness, classification, minimization, and authorization gates all allow it. Its
`check.openWorldHint` is therefore `true`.

## Host auto-review is a separate gate

An auto-review host can hold or refuse a policy-route `check` before Yoetz receives it. That is
host tool-call authorization, not a Yoetz semantic result: no semantic status, provider attempt,
or dispatch can be inferred from it.

For an explicitly requested semantic review or `semantic_required` check, the agent must pause and
present manual approval for that exact proposed request. Approval permits the host to invoke the
check only; it cannot alter Yoetz's provider, repository, privacy, disclosure, credential, or
dispatch authority. Once approved, the agent uses the same body and `request_id`. If the host
denies or the approval expires, the agent may use a deterministic-only fallback only after the user
explicitly chooses it after seeing the semantic-review limitation. A later Yoetz
`awaiting_human` result remains a separate Yoetz decision flow.

## Letting an auto-review host admit the authorized check

Claude Code auto mode, Codex `approvals_reviewer = "auto_review"`, and Cursor Auto-review each
put a second model in front of tool calls. All three refuse the same shape — data leaving the
machine to a destination the user did not name — and Yoetz's policy-route `check` is, by
design, exactly that shape. The privacy ceremony where you named that destination is invisible
to the host's reviewer, so without help every `semantic_required` check is held or refused.

Host admission is the way to hand the host your decision. It is one previewed, digest-bound step
per host and per repository that writes the host's *own* rule admitting exactly `check`:

```text
yoetz integrate claude admission preview --project-root . --claude-path ... --claude-config-root ... --cache-root ... --marketplace-root ...
yoetz integrate codex  admission preview --project-root .
yoetz integrate cursor admission preview --project-root . --cursor-config-root ...
yoetz integrate <host> admission grant --project-root . --accept --preview-digest <digest>
```

The preview shows the exact file and entry, the observed route, and whether the repository's
privacy grant permits external review. A grant is written only when all of these hold:

- the host's registered Yoetz route is `policy` (a strict route is never admitted; `check` on
  it still returns `blocked_by_policy` / `route_semantic_ceiling`);
- the repository grant permits external review;
- the host file carries no wider or conflicting rule for the same tool. A server-wide allow, a
  wildcard, a deny rule, or a Codex server-level default is reported as `foreign` and never
  edited or written beside;
- the file could be read. An unreadable file is `unknown`, never treated as empty.

Only `check` is ever admitted. Start, publish, respond, status, receipt, and guidance already
pass every host's rules.

What each host receives:

- **Claude Code** — `permissions.allow: ["mcp__yoetz__check"]` for an external registration named
  `yoetz`, or
  `permissions.allow: ["mcp__plugin_yoetz_yoetz__check"]` for the plugin-owned route in the
  repository's `.claude/settings.local.json`, which Claude Code resolves before its auto-mode
  classifier. Pass `--checkpoint` to write `permissions.ask` instead, which keeps a human prompt
  on every check that the classifier can never auto-approve. Granting the other mode later moves
  the existing entry between `allow` and `ask`; only granting the mode already set is a no-op.
  Claude Code holds the rules in this file until you trust the folder if the file is tracked in git.
- **Codex** — `[mcp_servers.yoetz.tools.check] approval_mode = "approve"` (or the
  `plugins."yoetz@yoetz".mcp_servers.yoetz` form for a plugin-managed route) in the project's
  `.codex/config.toml`, which Codex loads only for a project you have trusted. The reviewer is
  not invoked for that one tool; every other tool keeps its approval mode.
- **Cursor** — `mcpAllowlist: ["yoetz:check"]` in the workspace's `.cursor/permissions.json`
  for Auto-review, and `Mcp(yoetz:check)` (or `Mcp(plugin-yoetz-yoetz:check)` for a
  plugin-bundled server) in `.cursor/cli.json` for the Agent CLI.

The preview warns `host_config_not_compare_and_swap` for a mutation. Quit or pause settings
editors and other processes that may rewrite these host files while applying the accepted preview.
Yoetz rechecks the exact bytes immediately before each atomic replacement or deletion and verifies
the result, but an ordinary host configuration file has no portable compare-and-swap operation
that can exclude a non-cooperating process in the final filesystem syscall window.

### The way out

Every way in has a way out, and each is reported rather than silent:

- `yoetz integrate <host> admission preview --action revoke --project-root .` then `revoke`
  removes exactly the entry Yoetz wrote and nothing else in the file.
- Committing a privacy policy that no longer permits external review removes the entries for
  that repository in the same trusted ceremony.
- Removing the host plugin, unregistering the Codex route, or re-registering a route as strict
  removes the entry for the project named in that command.
- A leftover entry — one whose grant no longer permits review, or whose Codex route is now
  strict — is reported as `host_admission_drift` by `yoetz provider status`. That report reads
  each host's project-scoped admission file at the repository root even when you launch the
  command from a subdirectory.

Tightening the machine-wide ceiling does not reach into every repository's host files; the drift
report and the revoke command are how those are found and cleared.

### What admission does not do

Admission is host tool-call authorization. It does not prove a check dispatched, does not widen
what Yoetz may disclose, and does not skip any privacy, provider, credential, or human-review
gate; `check` still cannot widen policy and still stops at `awaiting_human` when Yoetz decides
it should. Yoetz never ships a hook that approves its own tool calls, and never softens the
`openWorldHint` a reviewer reads. When Claude Code auto mode denies a scoped `check` anyway,
`yoetz observe status` records one payload-free `host_auto_review_denied` diagnostic so the hold
is visible as what it is, not as a semantic result.

## Codex registration

`yoetz setup run` and `yoetz integrate codex mcp preview` show the exact command, route profile, and
digest before registration. A zero-egress setup selects the strict command. If provider/privacy
posture later changes, preview again: a Yoetz-owned registration with the other route profile is a
re-registration, not a silent mutation. A foreign entry named `yoetz` is never overwritten.

Inspect the active route through MCP initialize instructions or `status(view=versions)`. Registration
proves only the configured command; it does not prove that a host has launched it or that a provider
is ready.
