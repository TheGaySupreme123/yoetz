"""Bounded, nonsecret disclosure of the policy route's semantic review destination.

Issue #479. A host's automatic tool-call reviewer reads the initialize ``instructions`` (Codex
copies them into every tool description) and, before this module, saw only "external semantic
review follows the configured policy": no destination class and no payload bound. This module
renders one bounded passage from the configuration the bridge reads at startup so the reviewer can
score the call from a named destination rather than from nothing.

Every rendered value is either a closed catalog token owned by this module, a ``Literal`` field of
the validated configuration model, or a hostname that already passed the owner-declared HTTPS
origin validator. Nothing else from configuration reaches the text: no secret, filesystem path,
URL, query string, repository handle, or free-form prose. Absent, unreadable, or invalid
configuration renders as *unknown*, and an endpoint profile outside the bundled catalog renders as
an unknown destination rather than a guessed one. A configured fallback endpoint is disclosed
beside the primary because a reviewer told "only the primary can receive data" would be misled.

The passage carries no authority. It cannot admit the call (the ADR-018 amendment for #467 keeps
admission with the owner's trusted host configuration), cannot widen privacy policy, and does not
prove that a dispatch happened. It is stamped "read once at bridge startup": the bridge process
has one immutable route profile (ADR-018 decision 1) and reads configuration once, so a route
change after startup is reflected only after the host restarts the bridge; the live authority for
what a particular check did is that check's recorded ``semantic_status`` and provider attempt.
