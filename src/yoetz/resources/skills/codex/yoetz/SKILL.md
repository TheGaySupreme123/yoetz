# Yoetz for Codex

The first workflow operation is `start`. This includes `read_guidance` and commands. Read
`yoetz://guidance/agent-instructions.md` before it; page and verify empty or clipped guidance. If
start fails, follow same-request recovery first; ask the user for intro and guidance; do not work
without a task. Read-only skips.

After start, use `yoetz://guidance/workflow.md#start-and-resume` for resume/recovery/delegation/
capacity; publication policy before `publish_work`; coverage before `check`; and
`yoetz://guidance/request-templates.md` for setup. See [startup.md](references/startup.md).

Capacity and cost changes need a disclosed choice: never choose a larger or uncapped local
observation capacity for an ordinary task. On request run `yoetz observe selection-preview`, relay
the lower/pause/resume path, and apply only after the user accepts that preview. A no-cap request
returns `capacity_no_cap_unsupported`; See "Change local retention capacity" in [workflow.md](references/workflow.md).

For closure, publish evidence before `check`, answer findings, and request `receipt` last. At
`ready_with_limitations`, nothing further is to do: request the receipt without another check;
`standing_limitations` are disclosed, never tasks. A `respond` does not clear a finding.
Keep `unresolved_findings_remain`.
