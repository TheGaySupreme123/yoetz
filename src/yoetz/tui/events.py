"""The transcript event model.

The history is an append-only record of what Yoetz did and what it is prepared
to claim about it. Events carry an optional ``details`` block that the user can
open with ``D``; the summary above it never gets stronger because the details
exist. Events are frozen so a rendered transcript cannot drift from the moment
it described.
