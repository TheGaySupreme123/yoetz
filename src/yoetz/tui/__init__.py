"""The Yoetz full-screen terminal UI and its availability gate.

The gate is the important part of this module. A terminal UI is only ever
allowed to open for a human sitting at a real terminal: stdin and stdout must
both be TTYs, the caller must have asked for an interactive entry point, and no
CI marker may be present. Everything else — pipes, redirects, ``--help``, JSON
output, named protocol operations, the MCP server, and test fixtures — keeps its
existing byte-for-byte behaviour and never sees this code.

``run_tui`` degrades rather than fails: if the optional rendering dependency is
missing for any reason, the caller falls back to the ADR-013 prompt-loop menu,
which is still a complete interface over the same operations.
