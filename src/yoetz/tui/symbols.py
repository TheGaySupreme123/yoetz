"""Status symbols and the restrained colour vocabulary of the Yoetz terminal UI.

The symbol set is deliberately tiny and load-bearing: it is the only place the
interface is allowed to make a claim about how sure Yoetz is. ``VERIFIED`` means
a postcondition was actually observed; ``UNPROVEN`` means a step was configured
but never demonstrated. Nothing in the presentation layer may upgrade one to the
other, so both the glyph and the style live here rather than at each call site.
