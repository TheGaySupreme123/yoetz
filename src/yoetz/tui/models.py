"""Presentation-layer value objects shared by the runtime facade and renderers.

These types carry *already-decided* facts out of the application services and
into the views. They deliberately hold no behaviour beyond validation: every
judgement about whether something is registered, verified, trusted, or merely
configured is made by the owning service, and the terminal UI is only allowed to
transcribe it. Keeping the boundary as plain frozen data is what lets the
renderers be tested without a terminal and the runtime be tested without a
screen.
