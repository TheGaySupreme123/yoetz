"""Bounded asynchronous AI-powered review for observation advice (issue #619).

Hook ingest never calls a provider. The advice builder asks the scheduler for the durable
attempt that matches the current advice-candidate identity; when eligible it enqueues one
minimized packet and reports ``advice_semantic_pending``. A generation-fenced background worker later
claims the row, resolves repository-scoped provider authority at dispatch time, performs the
privacy-gated attempt, and records the outcome. Only a ``succeeded`` row with validated output
may add AI-powered advice; every other state stays a truthful bounded coverage gap.

Frequency bound (#888): reuse is keyed by the stable candidate identity (rule, kind, next action,
summary, and scoped gaps; never the rolling evidence basis or per-rule evidence counts). A
terminal non-success for that identity is re-admitted after an exponential backoff. A new
admission is
refused while the session's last provider-reaching attempt is younger than the configured
minimum interval; the refusal is reported as ``deferred`` and a revisit is scheduled for when
the interval elapses, so suppressed work is retried without waiting for another hook.

Reachability (#923): admission first asks whether a usable provider exists right now (an endpoint
bound, LLM-inference egress admitted by the machine policy, the configured credential present) and
whether the session's task route can reach it (ACTIVE, with a granted repository authority that
admits LLM inference). Without both, nothing is written and no revisit is scheduled; an
already-succeeded review of the same identity is still reused, and every other state reports
``provider_unreachable`` (the ``advice_semantic_unavailable`` gap), never ``pending``. The probes
run on every build, so a stored credential, an enabled channel, a granted repository, or a newly
bound provider (which recomposes the service) admits the next eligible condition without
restarting the host session. A row that still ends ``authorization_missing`` (authority lost
between admission and dispatch) waits out the base backoff like any pre-provider failure, so a
disagreement between probe and dispatch can never re-admit on every build.
