"""Typed classification for status read failures that are not the caller's fault.

A status request reaches the application already validated against its frozen schema. Caller
shape problems (a cursor, frontier, selector, or filter this request cannot use) are rejected at
explicit sites as ``INVALID_REQUEST``. A ``TypeError`` or ``ValueError`` raised after that is a
fault in stored state or in the service's own projection, and reporting it as invalid caller input
sends the agent to fix a request that was valid while discarding the only evidence of the real
defect (issue #840).

Each fault is therefore tagged with the stage that raised it and classified once:

- ``replay`` — a recorded ledger, lineage manifest, or stored row failed strict decoding. The data
  must not be retried and is escalated to the operator: ``STORAGE_CORRUPT``.
- ``model`` — a projected row failed its closed public wire model.
- ``digest`` — the snapshot identity could not be canonically digested.
- ``projection`` — any other internal failure while assembling the page.

The last three are the service's own defect: ``INTERNAL_ERROR``. Every classification records one
bounded diagnostic whose correlation id the public error carries, so the id an agent reports
resolves to the reviewed exception-class token and the innermost ``yoetz`` source origin. The
record never contains ``str(exc)``, a validation payload, a path, or any user content.
