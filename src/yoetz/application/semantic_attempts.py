"""Durable semantic-operation attempt budget, retry matrix, and accounting.

ADR-006: one durable semantic operation, at most two retries (``max_retries``), one total
deadline (``timeout_seconds``), and one physical attempt identity per dispatch. The ledger's
``semantic_jobs`` / ``semantic_attempts`` tables are the recovery authority — never a
memory-only coordinator object.

Two retry classes share that budget. Transient classes (timeout, transport, rate limit) may use
every remaining slot. The repair class — a response that reached the provider and came back
``invalid / response_content_invalid`` (incomplete or overlong output) — may use exactly one slot
per job (issue #348), resubmitting the same frozen case as a fresh physical attempt. Every other
invalid, refusal, policy, human, stale, quota, and secret class is terminal on first sight.

A declared fallback endpoint (issue #582) adds a second, separately budgeted endpoint behind the
primary. The primary is given up only for the closed fallback-licensing classes — it could not
serve at all (timeout, transport, rate limit, quota) — after ``FALLBACK_PRIMARY_FAILURE_LIMIT``
such failures, one quota exhaustion, or its own exhausted budget. Every content-shaped outcome
stays with the primary exactly as before. Which endpoint an attempt used is a pure function of
the durable rows before it, so crash and ``awaiting_human`` replay resume the same endpoint.
