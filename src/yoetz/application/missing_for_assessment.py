"""What an ``insufficient_packet`` review named as missing, fenced and classified (issue #907).

The reviewer may name only refs its packet carried. Yoetz, not the reviewer, decides whether the
agent can supply each item: a kind the effective review selection or channel can never carry, or a
target the owner redacted, is ``structurally_unavailable_on_this_host``; everything else is
``agent_suppliable``. A later review sees the earlier request beside what was recorded since, and
an item re-requested after it was supplied is dropped unless the reviewer cites that new material.
"Supplied" is judged per named target: only new material directly tied to that target counts
(its run, exact command, file path, or a correction of it), so a record that relates only to
another path, run or claim never answers it.

Reads the frozen projection and review selection. Its only filesystem access is resolving the
workspace root the caller supplies (an ``isdir`` check, then ``os.path.realpath``, once per
call); a path an agent recorded is compared lexically and never resolved or stat'ed.
