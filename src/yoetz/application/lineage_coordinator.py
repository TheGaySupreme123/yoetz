"""Service-side freezing of direct-child lineage manifests.

The coordinator is the only application component in the rollup path that may open a child
bundle.  It reads a child through the ready runtime's least-authority route, applies an explicit
source authorization gate, and writes one aggregate ``child_dependencies_recorded`` event to the
parent ledger when the structural facts changed.  Checks and receipts consume the resulting
parent rows through :mod:`yoetz.kernel.lineage`; they never call this module.

No user text crosses this boundary.  The request passed to ``source_gate`` names the three C9
lineage channels so the gate can apply the child's own source restrictions to each channel before
the service stamps a manifest.
