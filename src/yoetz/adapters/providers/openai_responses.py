"""Native OpenAI Responses AI-powered evaluation adapter for the approved external profile.

This module is the live provider bridge: it turns an already-approved outbound case into a
structured judgment and normalizes the provider's answer into Yoetz's closed AI-powered review result union
with provisional :class:`~yoetz.ports.semantic.ProviderAttemptProvenance`. It never manufactures
final receipt-bound provenance, never retries internally, and never lets a real credential enter a
reusable client, header, log, or exception. The ``openai``/``httpx`` SDK dependency is optional
(the ``semantic-openai`` extra); the module never imports ``openai`` at module scope so it keeps
importing cleanly when the extra is not installed, and resolves it lazily, once per physical
attempt, only inside :meth:`OpenAIResponsesEvaluator.evaluate`.
