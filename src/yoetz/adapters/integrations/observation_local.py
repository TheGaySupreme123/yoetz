        """Select advice to deliver once per *condition* identity. Never mutates state.

        Pure read by construction: the caller records the delivery with
        ``commit_advice_delivery`` only after the text has actually reached the
        agent. Persisting the identity here would mean a hook killed between
        the save and the stdout write suppresses that advice permanently, which
        is strictly worse than the storm this cadence exists to stop.

        Task-scoped conditions never fall back to the workspace-wide snapshot
        (#249). A mapped Yoetz session uses its own snapshot when present;
        otherwise selection is rebuilt from the current Codex session's
        retained envelopes. The workspace snapshot may contribute only
        deliberately standing machine conditions.

        ``allow_standing=False`` withholds standing machine conditions
        (STANDING_MACHINE_ACTIONS) and falls through to the highest-ranked
        actionable item, so those conditions reach the agent only on the
        session-boundary events that opt in (#241).
