"""Production provenance resolver for agent-context projections (issue #914).

``docs/INTERFACES.md`` conditions the ``agent_context`` ceiling on ``DisclosureProvenance``: an
item the requesting writer authored in this session, at or before the frozen frontier, returns to
that writer without a category grant. The rule was implemented by the egress decision but never
fired, because production composed ``LocalPrivacyEnforcer`` without a resolver and provenance was
always ambiguous. This resolver supplies it from ledger authorship the service itself read.

    no widening: other views, findings (including every AI-powered finding), receipts and any row
