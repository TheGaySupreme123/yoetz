"""Connection-free proof of the runtime's resolved Yoetz identity roots (issues #518, #567).

``yoetz service isolation`` resolves — locally, without touching any service, lock, or ledger —
which identity roots this exact process environment would use: state directory (service lock and
generation), runtime endpoint directory, effective storage bundle, selected config file, and the
Yoetz launcher. It reports each as a **path-identity digest** over the canonical resolved path,
never as a raw path. A dogfood preflight combines one exact normal-target report with one exact
isolated report, so relocated normal storage cannot be mistaken for separation.

Path identity is not byte content: an in-place edit of the selected config leaves
``config_path_digest`` unchanged. Only the opt-in content lane (``content=True``) binds the
config's bytes, as one bounded content observation carrying SHA-256, size, existence, and
observation time — never the bytes themselves (``yoetz.isolation-report/1``).

A set but unusable ``YOETZ_ISOLATED_ROOT`` propagates as the bounded ``PathSafetyError`` — the
mode is then unprovable and callers must fail closed, never report ``ambient``.
