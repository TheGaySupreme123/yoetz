"""Compatibility exports for the neutral workspace-locator boundary.

The resolver is shared by hook ingress, the CLI, and MCP. Its implementation lives in
``yoetz.adapters.workspace_binding`` so the ordinary MCP import graph does not reach the CLI package.
This module remains as a compatibility import for existing callers.
