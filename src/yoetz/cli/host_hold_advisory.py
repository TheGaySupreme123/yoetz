"""Advisory for an AI-powered ``check`` that a host's automatic reviewer held (issue #857).

Claude Code's ``PermissionDenied`` hook fires after auto mode denies a tool call. Until this module the Yoetz hook recorded one payload-free diagnostic
and said nothing, so the agent saw only the host's fixed refusal text and routinely downgraded a
review the owner had already authorized in the trusted privacy ceremony (issues #187, #467).

This module composes what the hook may say and do about that hold. It states Yoetz's own
first-hand facts — whether the repository grant permits external AI-powered review, read from the
running service inside the hook deadline, and the host's project-scoped admission state — and it
offers the host's documented ``retry`` exactly once per session. It never emits an allow
decision, never edits host configuration, and never asserts a grant it did not read: an
unreadable grant is ``grant_unread``, never confirmed. The host's own permission flow and the
human remain the authority (ADR-018).

Every rendered text is a fixed constant or a composition of closed tokens. No tool input,
reason prose, path, session id, or model output is echoed.
