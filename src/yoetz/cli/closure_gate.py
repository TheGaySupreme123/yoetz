"""The Stop-time closure gate (issue #977, ADR-033).

When an agent stops while the mapped task's closure readiness still names work the agent can do,
the Stop hook continues it once with a message that names what remains. The decision reads only
the service's own ``status`` answer (``closure_readiness``), never the transcript or a file:

* it continues only for ``STOP_GATE_TOKENS`` in ``agent_actionable``: open obligations, an
  unacknowledged receipt-blocking finding, and the task facts the agent can repair (a planned
  verification not observed, failing or stale; a requested output Git would not deliver);
* once per ledger frontier and session: a second Stop at the same frontier passes, so an agent
  that cannot or will not act is never trapped; the host's own loop guard (``stop_hook_active``,
  Cursor ``loop_count``) is honoured before any service read;
* an obligation a recorded blocker decision names (authority, consent, credentials, an
  unobtainable dependency) is a standing disclosure in readiness. Yoetz cannot verify the claim,
  so the first Stop that finds a blocker the agent has not been asked about continues the agent
  once with a re-check that names the obligation and the claimed kind (``blocked_obligations`` in
  readiness). The re-check is remembered per session and ``(obligation, kind)``: stopping again,
  or recording the same blocker again, is the re-confirmation, and the blocker is then honoured
  without asking again. Nothing judges the claim here; the closing review does (#976);
* while hook observations are still draining, the facts that depend on observed runs are not
  used to continue the agent.

The delivered text holds only closed tokens, counts and service-minted ids. The once-per-frontier
and once-per-blocker memory is two small owner-only files in the observation state directory
holding opaque session, frontier and obligation ids and closed blocker kinds.
