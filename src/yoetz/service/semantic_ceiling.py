"""Plan an AI-powered review case below the channel ceiling (issue #907 Phase 1b).

Privacy policy 1.2.0 lets the Expanded preset carry up to 64 excerpts, so a long session can build
a case whose prepared packet is larger than the channel's ``max_bytes`` or estimated
``max_tokens``. Egress refuses such a packet whole. Before that happens, the case is rebuilt with a
smaller excerpt byte budget. That is a narrowing of the approved selection, so it needs no consent.
The dropped excerpts are disclosed as ``content_unselected``, and the egress ceiling still decides
every dispatch.

The planner measures the payload the channel will release: items in a category or data class the
channel withholds are removed by local privacy minimization before egress, so they must not cost
eligible excerpts their room.

The reduction is a pure function of the case inputs, so a recovered review rebuilds the same case
and keeps its digest.
