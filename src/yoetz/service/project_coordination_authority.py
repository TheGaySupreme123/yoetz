"""Consent-backed authority for generation-bound project coordination grants.

Project coordination is local disclosure, but a general or cross-repository project still needs
an explicit generation-bound grant.  This module bridges the ordinary project application to the
existing owner-only elevated-consent ceremony.  It never accepts an authority label from a caller
and never treats a pending request as approval.
