"""Report control-plane saturation from a thread a blocked event loop cannot stall.

Invariant: the sampler thread never touches the stdlib logging sink. That path writes to stderr
under the handler's ``RLock``, which the loop thread also takes, so a full or unread stderr pipe
would block the one thread whose whole job is to keep reporting while everything else is stuck --
and it would do so holding a lock the loop needs. Records go straight to the durable diagnostics
ring, which has its own lock and its own file, and which is the sink an operator reads anyway
because MCP-spawned services swallow stderr.
