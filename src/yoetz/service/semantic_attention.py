"""Remember why the last AI-powered review attempt needs the user, per provider binding (#819).

Structural readiness proves a configured path exists; it cannot see an expired Codex login, a
rejected API credential, or an exhausted plan. Only a real attempt can. The service therefore
classifies each terminal provider attempt into one closed attention token (or clears it after the
provider answered) and the observation advice composition reads the current token as a standing
machine fact.

The state is deliberately in-memory and scoped to one READY generation: it adds no durable
record, and recomposition after setup, sign-in, disconnect, or restart starts clean. Only the
closed failure class and the adapter's closed runtime failure stage are consulted; provider text
never reaches a token.
