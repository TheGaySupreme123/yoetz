"""Built-in policy-pack identities: the current set and the earlier ones a ledger may carry.

A pack version names the rule table that produced a check execution or a local finding. A version
moves whenever a pack's rules change meaning, so a recorded check or finding always says which
rules produced it. New checks run only the current version of each pack. Every earlier version
stays decodable, because recorded ``check_recorded`` and ``finding_recorded`` events, check
results replayed from the ledger, and receipts keep the identity they were written with.

The versions of one pack form one lineage: an issue a newer version re-raises is the same issue,
and a later qualifying check at the same or a newer version of the pack can resolve it.
