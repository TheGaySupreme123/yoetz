"""Closed contract for the connection-free isolation proof (issues #518, #567, #571).

``yoetz service isolation --json`` emits ``yoetz.isolation-report/1``. It names two kinds of
digest apart:

* **Path-identity digests** (``path_identity.*_path_digest``) bind the canonical resolved path a
  root or file resolves to. They prove *which* target a runtime would use, never what bytes that
  target holds; a path-stable edit leaves them unchanged.
* **Byte-content digests** (``ContentObservation.content_digest``) bind the SHA-256 of one file's
  bytes at one observation time. They carry only the digest, size, existence, and time — never
  the content itself — and are produced only on explicit request.

The untagged 0.2 output (an ``identity`` block whose ``config_digest`` was a path-identity digest)
is not a schema version; consumers detect it by the absent ``schema`` key.
