"""Frozen recovery directives for typed public-error continuations.

Every value in this module is repository-authored text keyed by a typed token. Nothing here is
derived from a caller, a payload, a path, a provider, or model output, so a directive can be
rendered on any agent-facing surface without widening the egress boundary that
``CONTRIBUTING.md`` locks: "Nothing user-controlled ... appears in ... errors, or MCP text
summaries."

The point of the indirection is that the *token* travels and the *text* does not. A renderer
reconstructs the directive locally from the token, so the wire shape stays exactly as narrow as it
was before this module existed, and no ``safe_details`` key or ``public-error`` schema version was
added to carry prose (issue #739).

Directives restate what ``guidance/workflow.md`` already rules, in the one place an agent is
guaranteed to look: the error it just hit. When a rule changes, both move together — the
import-time gate below holds the vocabulary closed, and the guidance anchors are checked against
the registered resource set by ``yoetz.mcp.resources``.

A directive is an instruction, never a prediction. "Repeat the read with a new request_id" is
admissible because the error proves the read did not commit. "This will fix it" is not: the error
cannot substantiate an outcome, and coverage-bounded language forbids claiming one.
