"""Per-check AI-powered review budget profile (issue #571, ADR-006 amendment).

A check's semantic review runs under exactly one closed budget profile. ``final`` covers a
frontier that carries an effective completion claim; every other check is a ``routine``
checkpoint. The profile is a pure function of the frozen case, is frozen into the durable
execution snapshot, and is exposed to the provider adapter only for the duration of one physical
dispatch. Adapters map it to their own configured effort and output limit; the profile itself
never widens disclosure, retention, provider authority, deadlines, or retry policy.
