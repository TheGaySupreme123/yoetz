"""Findings as a converging to-do list (issue #905).

Every recorded finding is in exactly one to-do state, read from replay-derived projection facts
only, so status, check, receipts and ``respond`` all agree:

- ``open``: still to do.
- ``verified_resolved``: a later qualifying check proved it absent (``finding_is_resolved``).
- ``acknowledged_not_done``: the agent answered, with a required reason, that it will not do it.
  It is never re-reviewed and never reads as clean.
- ``rejection_accepted``: the agent rejected an AI-powered finding with a reason and a later
  review withdrew it. It no longer blocks a receipt but stays disclosed.

The last three are terminal: no transition leaves them, and ``respond`` refuses to record anything
further on a terminal item. New evidence about the same problem becomes a new finding. The
transition table is kept as data in ``TODO_TRANSITIONS``.

``review_rounds`` counts later checks that assessed an item and left it open. The owner's attempt
budget (``verification.finding_attempt_budget``, default 5) only changes what Yoetz asks for next:
at the budget it asks for a repair with new evidence or an explicit ``acknowledged_not_done``. It
never throttles ``check`` and never closes or acknowledges anything on the agent's behalf.
