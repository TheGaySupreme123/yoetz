"""Deterministic task facts derived from hook observations and the ledger (issue #977).

Yoetz's local checks used to describe only relations between ledger records ("no published
action names this item"). This module computes facts about the task's own work that the hooks
and the ledger already establish, so the agent can act on them:

* **Planned verification.** An effective obligation's ``requested_items`` of kind ``command`` is
  a verification the agent said it would run. Its exact identity is the installation-keyed
  command commitment the hook computes for every observed shell call (#909): the requested
  value gets the same light normalization and the same keyed commitment, so command text is
  never compared, stored or shown. A planned command is reported as never observed, as failing
  on its latest observed run, or as stale when an observed edit follows that run. A wrapped or
  reformatted variant is a different identity: the remedy is to run the planned command as
  recorded, or to correct the requested item to the command actually run.
* **Edits after the last verification.** An observed edit after the latest observed run the hook
  classified as ``test``, ``lint``, ``typecheck`` or ``build``.
* **Runtime facts** the hook classified at the host boundary (closed suffixes on the observed
  action description): a package install that resolved to Yoetz's own runtime or to a private
  virtual environment outside the workspace, an edit-tool write outside the workspace root, and
  verification that only ever ran as root.
* **Blockers.** A readable, unsuperseded ``decision_recorded`` whose statement holds the exact
  line ``yoetz-blocker:<kind>`` for a closed kind (authority, consent, credential,
  dependency_unavailable) and names ``affected_obligation_ids`` records that those obligations
  are blocked by something outside the agent's control. Yoetz cannot verify the claim; it
  honours it for the Stop-time closure gate and discloses it, and nothing else qualifies (missing
  data the task says is recoverable is not a blocker kind).

Self-generated evidence stays admissible here: no rule asks who produced a verification, only
whether the hooks observed it run, and when.

Every code is a closed token classified in ``kernel.closure_readiness.GAP_CLASSIFICATION``.
Requested-output facts need a check-time workspace read and live in ``requested_output_facts``.
