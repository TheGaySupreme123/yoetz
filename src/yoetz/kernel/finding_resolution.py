"""Proof-based finding resolution: which later check may resolve which recorded finding.

A finding is a historical fact and stays visible forever. Whether it is *current* is a separate
fact, and only one kind of evidence may change it: a later local check whose recorded
state contains the finding, whose matching policy pack ran to completion with nothing suppressed,
whose scope covers the finding's subject, whose coverage carries no weakening gap for the
finding's proof class, and which did not return the same issue again. A closed local-only
exception lets case-wide host-observation limitations remain on the receipt without vetoing clean
structured-ledger proof, and a bounded AI-powered review selection stays disclosure rather than a
veto on proof it did not weaken. A response disposition never resolves a finding; it only answers
it on the record. Weak, skipped, failed, capped, stale, unreadable, or non-overlapping checks do
nothing, and nothing here ever strengthens coverage.

Everything in this module is pure and replay-derived, so a receipt, a status counter, and a
projection checkpoint all read the same fact.
