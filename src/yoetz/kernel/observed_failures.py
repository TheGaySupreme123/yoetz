"""One shared reading of hook-observed failed runs at a completion claim (#909).

A completion claim must disclose failed work that is still *live* when it is made. For a result
the harness observed (a hook-observed tool call), a later qualifying run can make an earlier
failure history instead of an omission:

* **Supersession.** A later hook-observed run of the *same command identity* succeeded, or ran
  again with another limiting outcome (failure or partial): only a run with a recorded outcome
  can replace the earlier disclosure duty. An unknown outcome does not certify repair. The
  identity is the installation-keyed ``hmac-sha256:`` command commitment the hook computes and
  materialization stores as ``omitted:<commitment>`` in the action's ``command`` field; the raw
  command text never reaches the ledger. Any other command, and any unkeyed or structural
  placeholder, supersedes nothing.
* **No edit inference.** A workspace edit changes the state being verified, but it does not prove
  that a failed validation was repaired or passed. A failed run therefore stays live until a
  later qualifying run of the same keyed command identity (or an explicit claim acknowledgement)
  resolves its disclosure duty. Legacy rows without a command identity
  (``omitted:structural``) never fall back to "every failure is live" supersession.

Only service-stamped hook observations take part on either side: a cooperative result keeps its
exact ADR-025 disclosure duty, and a cooperative "success" or "edit" can never retire a hook
failure. A superseded or legacy historical failure is not deleted or hidden: the receipt counts it
once as history, and naming it in ``limitation_refs`` stays accepted.

The work-integrity and research-evidence packs, the claim-revision replay invariant, the receipt
builder and the observation-advice rule all read this module, so no two of them can disagree
about which observed failure is still live.
