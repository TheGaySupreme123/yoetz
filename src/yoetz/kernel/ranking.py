    ``rank_key`` puts origin ninth of ten, so finding kind dominates and enough deterministic
    findings out-rank every semantic one. That ordering is deliberate and is left alone. What
    changes here is how many reserved seats survive it: the rescue used to be exactly one, so a
    reviewer that raised two or three material challenges had all but the best silently folded
    into ``suppressed_count``. Up to half the cap is now reservable, which keeps deterministic
    findings in the majority while letting more than one challenge be seen.

    ``max_findings == 1`` reserves nothing and stays deterministic-only, unchanged from before:
    the single seat goes to the highest-ranked finding, because reserving it would mean returning
    a semantic challenge in place of every deterministic finding rather than alongside them.
